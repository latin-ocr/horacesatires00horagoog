25-24· This letter was therefore written somewbere between 24
and 20.

Beyond this nothingis known of the young man, but he may well
have been a relative of the distinguished M. Lollius to whom Carm. 4,
9, is addressed. ,

‘My dear young friend, l have just been re-reading Homer and
arn struck with tbe wealth of illustration of philosophie doctrines
in his poems. He is really better than the philosophers themselves.
Just consider the debate between Antenor and Paris or the quar·
rel between the two chiefs of the Greeks. The follies of kings could
not be better shown. And Ulysses‚ in the Odyssey, is as good as
a Stoic; recall the description of him in the opening of the poem.
And you and 1 are there, too, in the picture of the easygoing Phaea-
crans.

‘But don't be too easy-going, don't postpone too long the beginning
of serious philosophie living. There are temptations everywhere. Do
not be like the men who hope to find happiness in their possessions,
instead of eleansing their own hearts. Avoid pleasure, love of money,
envy, anger, especially anger. Begin early to train yourself. But
don’t expect me to be your companion in the path of reform, lam
middleaged and 1 go my own sober way.'

The tone of the letter is half serious, half light, as suits an older
man's advice to a younger friend. It is probable that the advice has
some personal applications which ean no longer be understood, but the
general tenor is impersonal; begin in youth to train yourself to virtue.
