INTRODUCTION

. found thinker. He was a man who had seen much of life on

various sides, had observed many· men and had given serious
thought to their conduct and his own. Out 'of this experience
and consideration, he had come to certain conclusions which
he had formulated into what we call, loosely,a philosophy of
life. It was not, of course, a philosophy of the schools3 it did
not concern itself with questions of natural or physical science
or with the nature of knowledge, and, though it was ethical, it
did not involve the fundamental problems of ethics. But it had
this in common with ethical philosophy, that it was based upon
a real comprehension of vital interests and that it was to Horace
a true and determining principle of life. In this sense he was
justified in regarding himself as a philosopher and in feeling
it to be his right and his duty to summon other men to accept
his doctrine. He is thus, as indeed he had been in the earlier
days of the Satires, a preacher, uttering his doctrine with con-

· viction and seriousness. Perhaps it should rather be said that

he was at once preacher and artist. The variety of setting and
of personalities which a collection of letters involves afforded
him an opportunity to set forth his philosophy with variety,

as a climax and a final answer to all troubles and queries and·

situations.
. The subject of the Second Book is literature; the three long
letters consist of comments on the prevailing tendencies of

0literature in Rome. In this comment some two or three ele>

ments are combined. Horace had read, though perhaps not
very deeply or widely, the treatises on rhetoric and on the
history of literature, and he made considerable use of the knowl-
edge thus acquired. Much of this, however, must be recognized
as conventional and traditional, without any very real connection
with the condition of things in Rome. Especially the history
of literature, of the drama or the satura, or the origins of certain
poetic forms, which was once accepted as authoritative‚ must
not be taken seriously. Horace had no access to real sources,
