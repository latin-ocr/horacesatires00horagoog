καὶ ῥήματα, standing for all lan·
guage3 cf. Sat. 1, 3, 103.

235. The address to the Pisones
at this point is consistent with the
more personal and direct tone of
the whole discussion of the Satyr
plays, and supports the view that
the matter was one of living inter-
est at the time. — scriptor: this
also maintains the tone of direct
interest, but does not, of course,
mean that Horace himself intended
to write for the stage.

236. nec sic: ‘nor should Ι be
satisfied with a mere distinction
between the tragic and the comic
style, without observing also the
finer distinctions between the dif-
ferent characters)

237-239. Davus : a standing
name for a slave in comedy. —
Pythias: this 'name for the arguta
meretrix (Sat. 1, 10, 40) happens

'not to be used in any extant

comedy. — emuncto: one of the
many slang words used in comedy
for cheating; perhaps swtped. —
Simone: an old man; Chremes is

Μ

used as the ῒγρᾝεωε in the

correspondingh passage in Sat. 1,
10, 4off.— T e names and the
situation all refer to the comoedia
palliata, like the plays of Terence,
the style of which, it is implied, is
not to be used in a Satyr play. —
Silenus: the old guardian and
attendant of the youthful Diony-
sus. fond of wine, but also a kind
of philosopher.

240-243. This passage contains
a summary of Horace's own ideal
in style, of wider application than
is given to it here. — noto fictum:
the same general contrast as that
expressed in vs. 151, sic verisfalsa
remiscet. —- speret: i.e., the style
shall seem easy enough to tempt
any one to try it.—idem, idem:
intentionally repeated in the same
place in the verse. — series iunc-
turaque: cf. callida iunctura,
47 f.; but here the thought is
broader, including all the more
general characteristics of style,
not the meaning of words only.
— de medio sumptis: ordinary
