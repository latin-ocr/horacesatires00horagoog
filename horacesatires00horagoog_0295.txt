The date of this Epistle cannot be definitely iixed. The absence of
any allusion to the Odes in vs. 1 seems to require a date before 23 u.c.‚
when the Odes were published‚ and the reference to 3 favorable judg·
ment expressed by Tibullus in regard to the Satires points to a still
earlier date. Tibullus returned to Rome from a campaign in Aquitania
in 27 and may then for the first time have read the Satires.

Albius Tibullus, addressed in this epistle and in Carm. 1, 33, the
elegiae poet, was a younger friend of Horace and a man of attractive
character. He was, however, of a somewhat melancholy temperament,
and this note of general invitation and inquiry is intended to cheer him.

‘What are you doing at your home in Pedum, my dear Albius?
Writing or philosophizing in silence ? The gods have given you much3
be grateful for what you have. lf you will make me a visit, you will
find metatam cheerful, as an Epicurean ought to be)
