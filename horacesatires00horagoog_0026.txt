INTRODUCTION

oi Damasippus in Sat. 2, 3, or the longer description by sugges·
tion in Sat. 1, 9, is as true and as recognizable now as it was
when it was written, because it presents the essential qualities
which are oi no single period or race. The power to draw
such pictures is not, it is true, the highest kind of artistic power, ¹
and it does not necessarily carry with it either a proiound phi-
losophy or great breadth oi view. Great artists have lacked it,

and some caricaturists have had it. The most obvious modern
illustrations are in fiction3 George Eliot had not a trace oi it;
Anthony Trollope had it in a high degree. Such little pictures
do not teach us the meaning oi life, in its larger aspects and
relations, They teach usin a nearer way about people3 they
· show us how to analyze and classify3 they stimulate our in-
telligent comprehension oi the men we meet The reader oi
Horace, il he gets his lesson truly, understands better the man
who sits in the seat next to him, and, if he becomes a true
disciple, he understands himself better, too.
