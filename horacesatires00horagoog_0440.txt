2, 3] HORATI

with inharmonious ornaments 3 nor should the poet, avoiding one fault,
fall into its opposite. H ony depends in part upon a wise choice of
subject, which insures gokfflnngement. Choice of words also con·
tributes to harmony of effect, for words suffer change, like all human
things.

‘The meters and style of different kinds of poetry are tixed by tradi-
tion, from which it is not easy to break away. Tradition also fixes the
outlines of characters, and in all these matters it is best to follow a good

el, in order that your characters may speak as befits their nature
and their period of life.

‘ln the drama, too, one should follow the best usage, with five acts
and three speakers. As to the chorus, it should take a sympathetic
part in the aetion, and the music and the dress of actors should not be
too prominent. The satyrio drama presents peculiar difficulties, owing
to the mingling of the heroic and the comic.

‘In the observance of metricallaws our Roman poets are too careless,
afault for which, as the history of the Greek drama shows, nothing will
atone. · Inspiration is nota substitute for training; it is a kind of mad-

· ness and, for myself, l prefer to avoid it and to devote myself to laying

down laws for other writers.

. ‘The poet must enrich his mind by reading and observation and train
himself to avoid faults. Not that all faults can be avoided; even Homer

sometimes nods. Yet, for a poet, mediocrity is failure, and only train-

ing can teach us how to escape that. We must listen to the real critics,

not to flatterers. Untrained inspiration is mere madness‚ and l do not

want to see you a madman.'

The fact that the course of thought is rambling is the key to an
understanding of the Epistle. F or this arrangement is not the result
of carelessness3 Horace followed this unsystematic and yet closely
knit succession of topios from deliberate choice. He was not trying to
compose a treatise, but to write an epistula, a semo. Like any epistle,
it is addressed to certain persons, and, like any serum, it follows the
line of easy transitiou by suggestion from one topic to another. This
is in itself a form of art, the particular form to which Horace had trained
himself, and this Epistle is to be interpreted precisely as Epist. 2, 1 and
2, 2 are to be interpreted. That this intentionally unsystematic poem
should have ·been taken for a formal treatise on the art of poetryis
indeed surprising3 the error was due in part toa too literal understand·
ing of the traditional title, in part to a general tendency among early
scholars to overvalue the content of classic literature. lt should be
valued rather as a beautifully finished terma to be studied forits skillful
