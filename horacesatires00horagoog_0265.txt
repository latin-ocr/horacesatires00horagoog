INTRODUCTION

while r, 2 is a letter chiefly by virtue of the address and the
closing lines, and r, 6 is not a letter at all, but a sermo on
philosophy addressed to an individual. To the skilliul mingling
01111000 two elements, the personal and the public, Horace has
plainly devoted much thought, shaping the Epistle into a
literary 101111, as he had shaped the dialoguesatire, and per-
haps extending its range, as he had extended the range 011110
Α10010 stanza. ⁸

All this, however, applies chiefly to the First Book. In the
Second Book there is less attempt to preserve the epistolary
101111. ‘ibe Ars Poetica 1100 scarcely anything but the address
to remind the reeder that it is an Epistle. In 2, 2 the fiction
01 excusing himself 110111 further writing 01 lyrics is used by
Horace to 1010101101101110001111011110 thought through the
1110111011, but the latter part is quite impersonal. The letter
to Augustus (a, 1) is inevitably formal, but the cousciousness
that it is addressed to one who had it in his power to influence
the trend 01 literary taste is present through the whole and influ-
ences the thought.

1t is not to be thought, however, that Horace's attention was
given wholly to the torm 01 his writings. He was primarily
an artist in words and phrases and forms 01 expression, but he
had also something to say. In the First Epistle he announces
the subject 01 1110 new collection3 he has given up lyric poetry
and is to devote 1111110011 hereafterto philosophy, not, indeed, ο
1110 philosophy oia sect, but the philosophy 01 lite. This
announcement fairly describes the subject-matter or the point
01 view 01 the 110011. Α100 01 the Epistles (1, 53 1, 93 1, 13)

things lead back to the large philosophy 01 1110. Βο1 Horace
