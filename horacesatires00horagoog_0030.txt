‘Enough ol sermonizing. l'm no Crispinus’

The subjectos this introductory satire is the race t'or wealth. ln the
universal peace which followed the civil wars, the finaucial affairs of the
world centered at Rome as an imperial clearing house, and great for·
tunes were rapidly made by men of the capitalist class. ln general, the
old nobility 3ηά the philosophers and writers kept aloof from business,
which consequently tell into the hands of the equites, who had had only
a slight part in public affairs, or of the freedmen, who were ill-fitted by
character and experience to make a large-minded or even a rational use
ol their money. Some of them burst out into ridiculous display, and
furnished easy material for the satirist3 others, with less obvious folly,
knew no better use of their acquired wealth than to make it the means
of acquiring still more. Itis tomen of the latter class that this dis·
course is addressed. For this is not pure satire, holding up the pecul-
iarities of certain men to the scorn ol others3 it is, in part, a discourse,
a sermon, addressed directly to the over-eager man os business, 3ηά
intended to show to him, sor his possible betterment, the intrinsic little-
ness ol the occupation to which he was so ardently devoting himself.

· Horace frequently employs in other places the thoughts 3ηά some-
times the figures 3ηά expressions of this satire. Compare especially
the end of Epode 1, the main thought of Epode 2, and the whole of
Epode 4. The similarity between the social structure ot' the Augustan ,
Age 3ηά our own times could scarcely be made more vivid than it is by
the lact that the satirist ol that society chose lor the theme of his open-
ing satire the raee lor wealth.
