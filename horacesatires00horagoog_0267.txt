INTRODUCTION

tor example, of the early Latin literature, no such sources ex·
isted. This element in his writings has no great value or inter·
est A second element has more lire in it; in so iar as his
¹ comments reveal the tendencies of contemporary literature, they
have real value. The extant remains ol the literature oi the
Augustan Age, even though they include so much, are but
scanty in amount compared with the writings of all kinds that
were published in that period, and all the glimpses that we get
in Horace ol the work of younger men oroi minor writers
enable us to understand better the literature that has survived.
A third element is the most important ol all3 itis the personal
judgment which Horace expresses For the work oi the critic
he was all the better qualified because his own work was not
inspired‚ but was the result of a conscious process He had
thought much of the choice ot words, ot the combination oi
phrases, oi the enlargement oi vocabulary, and all that he says
on such thing's is weighty with authority. One ol the most
interesting of experiences is to hear a good craltsman speak oi
the art that he practices. It is this which makes Cicero's
Brutus and Orator interesting; Horace’s presentation is more ι
indirect than Cicero’s and less systematic‚ but it has the same
essential quality of authority.
' It is not always possible to distinguish these three elements,
the traditional‚ the contemporary, and the personal, but so far
as it is possible it throws much light upon the meaning ol these
Epistles. Thus it is probable that the great space given to the
drama has nothing to do with Horace’s own interest, it may
be due to some transient public interest, but itis probablya
tradition from the books of rhetoric. On the other hand, it is
not unlikely that the discussion ol the satyric drama is to be
explained by a revived interest in mimes and larces. But

much of the general discussion of poetry, the injunctions to fre· κ

quent revision, the constant reference to Greek models, comes
from Horace himself and constitutes the most attractive element
