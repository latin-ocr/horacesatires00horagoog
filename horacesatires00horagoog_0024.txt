INTRODUCFION

school or university curriculum in all countries 3 they have been
translated more often than me works of any other ancient
writer, and have decply influenced modern literature. All this
is evidence of the high esteem in which his poetry has been
held by scholars and men oi letters; the estimate of men oi
affairs oi men outside' of academie lite, is somewhat similar.
For it is probably true that of all the writers oi Greek and Latin
poetry-many of them greater than Horace-no one has so
frequently been carried away from the university lile and be·
corne a part of the familiar intellectual iurniture of educated
men in active life. The explanation of an interest so wide-
spread and so long-continued is not, oi course, to be sought in
those qualities or characteristics which Horace sharcs with
otber writers. He reflects, it is· true, a highly interesting period
in history, but the letters oi Cicero are an even more vivid re-
flection of a more critical period. His poetic form, as it is
worked out in the lyrics, is most admirable, and poetic form is
one of the main reasons ior our continued study oi the two
classic literaturcs, but the range of its attractive power is
limited. That which has differentiated Horace from other
writers and made him permanently attractive to men of widely
varied taste is independent of his circumstances and, to a con-
siderable degree, oi his artistic form3 it lies partly in the
personal character which his writings disclose and partly in the
permanent worth oi his comments upon life.

The character oi awriter or an artist as it shows itself in his
work must be learned by indirection, by impressions repeated
and deepened into familiarity. For this kind oi personal ac-
quaintance Horace gives abundant material. Enough has been
said above to correct the notion that he was a dilatante, playing
with lire. He was, it is true, fundamentally an observet rather
than an actor, and he was by temperament genial and tolerant;
these are the qualities upon which the charrn oi his personality
rests3 but a merely temperamental tolerance is, like tempera-
