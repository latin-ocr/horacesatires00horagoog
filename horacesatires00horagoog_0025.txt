INTRODUCTION

mental optimism‚ a very superficial and uninteresting quality.
Horace was a man oi warm feeling and oi strong convictions,
though his convictione are in part alien to our thought, and the
lightness with which he sometimes touches serious things is not
the lightness oi carelessness. He had learned early, not with·
out struggle and pain, the lesson oi adjustment to the limita·
tions oi lite, had learned that the secret ol a composed and
dignified lile lies iu the acceptance oi the inevitable. Even iu
his lesscheeriul moods he iaced his heaviest losses with steadi-

ness· durum: sed leviusfitpatientia,
quidquid corrigere est nefas.

But his ordinary mood was not tragic3 he preferred to meet
lire with a smile, not underestimating the possibilities oi loss
and trouble, but also not overestimating them. And it is the
fact that his genial acceptance oi liie rests upon a foundation oi
cool judgment and shrewd comprehension that gives it mean-
ing. Itis this combination that makes him the philosopher ior
men oi the world. For the man oi affairs, ii he is conscious oi
liie at all, is seelring for a formula which will include all the
iollies and weaknesses of men and will teach him how to accept
them with a smile. The real meaning of Horace’s philosophy
is poorly expressed by nil admirari, as the words are commonly
understood, and not very well by aurea mediocritas ‚· it is a phi·
losophy oi comprehension and tolerance, and the charm oi his
personality is that he so perfectly embodies his own doctrine.
The value of his comments upon men and society lies partly
in the application oi his philosophy to life, partly in the peculiar
forms in which he expresses it. His satires‚ and, to a less
degree, his epistles, are a picture gallery. He does not describe
individuals or, ii he does, it is in terms so general as to make
them types, his little pictures are done in few lines, but in lines
so expressive that they tell the essential truth about a man.
Such a characterization as that oi Tigellius in Sat. 1, 3 or that
