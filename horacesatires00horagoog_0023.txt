was still strong in him, and after the publication of the Odcs

η he resumed his commentary on life and society in the form

of epistles in hexameter. By the choice of a new and different
form he freed himself from the limitations of satire3 at the
same time, as the tradition of the epistle in verse was less
definitely fixed, the new form did not hamper him. The in-
terval that separates such a satire as 2, 6 from such an epistle
as 1, 7 is very slight; by addressing the satire to Maecenas, he
could easily have made it an epistle in form, and with a few
modifications the epistle might bave been published witb the
Satires. It might be said that the three collections of hexame
ter poetry represent three steps in a continuous process3 the
First Book of the Satires is, in the main, satire aiter the man·
ner of Lucilius, the Second Book is an experiment with the

· dialogue form, and the First Book of the Epistles marks the

complete breaking away from the Lucilian tradition. They are
three stages in the working out of a literary form within which
the temperament oi Horace could express itself with the least
possible sense of restriction.

Before his death, which occurred on the ²Lthffl⁰f November,
8 nc, Horace was already recognized as the greatest oi Ro
fritislyric poets and as the most conspicuous figure, next to
Vergil, in the literature of his time. This position his poems
retained aiter his death3 they were universally read and were
used as text-books in schools Critical and learned commen-
tary began to gather about them in the first century of the Em-
pire, and, before the fall of Roman power in the West, copies
of his works were in wide circulatim, often prefaced by the
account of his life from Suetonius and annotated with scholia.

Ἴ During the Middle AgeS, when knowledge of the ancient world
η was at its lowest, his poems were still read in schools and fre-
, quently copied in the monastery libraries, and with the Revival
, of Learning many editions were issued from the early printing
, presses. In modern times they have formed a part of the
