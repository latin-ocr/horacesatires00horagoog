these words are not quite intelli-
gible‚ since spondees had been
used in iambic trimeters from the
earliest times. [Ν one of the vari-
ous explanations is really good.
Cic. Brut. 10, 41 is not a parallel]

256. stabiles: heavy in compar-¹
ison with the lightly running iambi.
- in iura paterna: adopted them
legally.

257. non ut. ‘but not to the
extent of admitting them to the
second or fourth foot.'

258. socialiter: ‘like an ally‚'
like one who made a partnership
on absolutely equal terms. The
personification of the iambus goes
through the whole passage, iussit,
recepit, commodus et patiens, ce·
deret.

iambus. —- nobilibus: well· known,
without approval, which would be
inconsistent with the context.—
rarus: this supplies, in thought,
the subject of premit,· ‘and the
rarity of it in the verses of Ennius.'
-in scaenam missos: his verses
in drama, as distinct from his epic
poetry. — operae: with crimine, as
artis is, and modified by nimium
celeris and carentis.

263—264. non quivis: the mean·
ing of the general phrase appears
in Romanis. — indigna : unde·
served ,· strictly, ‘ pardon that the
giver should think it unworthy of
himself to bestow.'

265. idcirco: i.e., ‘ because 1
know that the judge is not strict.’

266-267. tutus et . . . cautus:
‘or shall I'be just careful enough
to keep within the law? '
