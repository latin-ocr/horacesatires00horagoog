EPISTVLAE [1, 16, 37

respondesne tuo, dic sodes, nomine? 'Nempe
virbonus et prudens dici delector ego ac tu.’

Qui dedit hoc hodie, cras, si volet, auferet, ut, si
detulerit fasces indign0, detrahet idem.

35 ‘ Pone, meum est‚’ inquit: pono tristisque recedo.
Idem si clamet furem, neget esse pudicum,
contendat laqueo collum pressisse paternum, ·

Epist. 1, ς, 15. lt is a perfectly ³4· fascea: sor any high office.
natural deviation from the mechan· —detrahetz not with reference to
ical accus. and nota Grecisrn. Cf. any legal impeachment, but merely
Sat. 1, 1, 19, licet esse beatri. as a vivid expression for the with-
31. respondemus not equal'to drawal of favor.
nonne respondes, but withaformal 35.‚The figure in this vs. is
neutrality3 ‘do you answer or do slightly changed from that of the
you not i' - tuo . . . nomine: i.e., preceding line ς it is the figure of
‘for yourself) by accepting the aperson taking up au object, any
description as really applioeble to object, and being interrupted by
you. -dic sodes: a formula of the rightful owner. The subject
appenl, as in Epist. r, 1, 62. of mcum est is not officium (from
sodes :si audes, with the earlier fasces) or nomen. but is entirely
meaning ofaudeo(=avidc0, aveo). indefinite3 ‘put that down, it's
32. bonus et prudens: a more mine) The variation of thought
modestsubstituteforsapiensemen· in vss. 33, 34, 35, is thoroughly
datusque. -delectorz intention· Horatian3 ‘public opinion may
ally stronger than patarih-ac take away reputation,as thevoters
tuta retort3 ‘just as you do, in may take away the office they gave,
spite of your superior tone.’-The or as any man may reclaim what
whole line is a restatement of vs. is his own)
30, but in terms which satisfy the 36. idem: the person who is
speaker better than pateris sapiens vaguely thought of as the subject
emendatusque3 ‘of course I like to of inquit, with aslighter reference
becalledarespectableandsensible back to the subjects of detrahet
man,and so do you! and auferet. The force of idem
33. qui dedit: i.e., public opin- is, as often, adversative, ‘but
ion. The reply, as so often in when that same man accuses me
Horace, begins without an intro· unjustly, l can regard him with
ductory conjunction, at or scd. indifference.'
Cf. Sat. 1, 1, 36. 37. laqueo: this is aproverbial
