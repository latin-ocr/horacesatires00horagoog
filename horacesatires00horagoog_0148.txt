HORATI

‘Trebatius people say that my satire is worthless. What shall Ι do ·
about iti—Keep still t-what, not write at alli-Ves—By Jove,
you may be right. But l can't go to sleep. — Can't sleep? Take some
exercise and drink a bottle of wine just before bed-time aud you will
sleep perfectly well. Or, if what you mean is that you can't stop writing,
¹ then write about Caesar, that is work that will pay you—l wish l
could, my dear sir, but Iam not equal to describing battles.-Then
write about his justice and his energy.-Some other time, per·
haps3 just now Ι don't think I will try it. -It would be a great deal
better than the things you do write, which make enemies ou all sides.
-1 can't help myself. Writing is my hobby. Ihave fighting blood
in my veios, as Lucilius had in his. But l never attack3 Isimplyde·

. course. Some of your great friends will turn a cold shoulder to you·-

What, did Lucilius's friends desert him? I am not as great a man
ashe was, but if any man attacks me, he will find that l am no easy
prey- unless, of course, you advise differently-No, l don't think I
can say anything against that. But there are libel laws for the writers
of bad verses. — Bad verses! Yes, but mine are not bad; they are very
good. Can Ι be sued for writing good versesi— Certainly not. Good
poetry is above all law.' ’

ln issuing a second collection ofwritings in the same style as that by
which he had already won both friends and enemies‚ Horace thought it
well to preface it with a further defence of satire, continuing the subject
of 1, 4 and 1, 10. But as 1, 10 is at once less serious and more assured
than 1, 4, so this satire is less obviously argumentative than 1, ro. Its
underlying purpose is self-defence and explanation, but under the cover
of pure burlesque. lt represents aconsultation between Horace and his
legal adviser, C. Trebatius Testa. The latter is well known to us
through the group of letters addressed to him by Cicero (ad Fam. 7, 6-
22) ; hewas a distinguished jurisconsult anda man of much humor, and
therefore a suitable figure for a burlesque consultation. The dialogue
is managed with great skill; Trebatius, in a dry, legal manner, gives
prudent advice, which Horace rejects as fast as it is given, arguing with
much beat in favor of the course that he had already determined upon
before he went through the form of consulting the lawyer. The argu-
ments, too, by which Horace defends his course are all farcical: Mi·
lonius gets drunk and dances, therefore l may write satire, the bull
gores, the wolf bites, and Scaeva poisons his mother, therefore Ι may
use my satire to wound and poison. From beginning to end there is
