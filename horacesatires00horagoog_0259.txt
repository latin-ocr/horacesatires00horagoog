PREFACE

’ Ia has been taken for granted in the preparation of
this edition that the Epistles are not read until after the
Satires and perhaps after the Odes, and parallels in the ς
earlier poems have been rather freely used ior illustra-
tion. In othe'r respects the commentary is like that upon
the Satires, and is intended to direct the attention of the
reader both to the artistic structure of the Epistles and to
the body of ideas which Horace was endeavoring to ex·
pressio them. Ι have tried to remember that the student,

learning his lessons‚ is in reality a reader.
E. P. MORRIS.
