INTRODUCl’ION

tion, as well as disenchantment and difficulty, have done their
part in shaping his character.

It was in the decade between 41, when he returned after
Philippi, and 30, when at the age of thirty-five he published the
Epodes and the Second Book of Satires, that his character and
his life philosophy were matured. F ew events are known to us
out of these years. In 39 or 38 he was introduced by Vergil
and Varius to Maecenas, and in Qeceived from Maecenas
the gift of the Sal-›ine- farm, which was in a special sense his
home for the re‘st of his life. But the intimacy with the circle
of poets and critics who were gathered about Maecenas, greatly

He began with agroup of three satires, 2, 7, and 8 of Book I,
and it was these which, with some of the Epodes, brought him
to the notice of Vergil, and ultimately of Maecenas. They are

of subject. On the other hand, the style of the seventh is good,
the eighth is better than most poemsof its kind, and the second,
except in the choice of subject, is the real Horace, easy in style
and handling, humorous and yet in acertain way serious. There
is enough oi sharpness and even of bitterness in it to explain the
criticisms that it brought upon the writer, and the tone of the
next satire, 4 oi Book I, shows that Horace was himself aware
that the earlier satires needed defense, if not apology. But a
clear-sighted critic, on the lookout, as the members of the circle
