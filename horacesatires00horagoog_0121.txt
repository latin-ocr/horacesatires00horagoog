SERMONES [1,8,9

absence of data, on the general grounds of tone and manner- the lack
of real humor, the coarseness, the cynicism — the satire may be placed
with 2 and 7 os this book in the group of earlier writings.

The fact that the speaker is the figure of the garden god Priapus
gives to the satire a certain resemblance to the Priapea, os which we
have a collection, but in substance this is a satire upon the kind ol
incantations described by Vergil in Eclogue 8. On the personal side
it is an attack upon a certain Canidia, who is also savagely attached in
Epode 5 and ironically ridiculed in Epode 17, and who is mentioned
in several places in the Satires and Epistles. The scholiast says that
her real name was Gratidia, that she was a seller of drugs, a witch and
a poisoner. How much of this is fact we do not know, but undoubtedly
a real person is referred to under the name. The hostility with which
Horace pursues her is distinctly unpleasant, and this poem and Epodes
5 and 17 reveal him od his least admirable side.
