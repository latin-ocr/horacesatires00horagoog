ARS POETICA

Of all the writings of Horace none hasbeen more earefully studied
and more elaborately discussed than this Epistle. Yet it must be said
Ι that, in consequence of the insufficiency of data, there is still consider·
³ able uncertainty in regard to the date, the persons addressed, the occa·
sion and purpose, and even the title.

The internal evidence in regard to the date of composition or publi· ¹

cation is both scanty and indefinite. lt is to be found in the references
to persons, to Vergil and Varius (55), to Cascellius (370), to Tarpa
(387), and to Varus (438). But no one of these is precise. The con·
text and the purpose of the allusion is such as to be suitahle to a person
still living or to one who had passed into literary tradition. There is
a like uncertainty in regard to the allusions to public works in vss. 63 ff.;
they are too vague to afford material for dating.

The only external evidence of any weight is the statement of Suetonius

- that Augustus asked for and received Epist. 2. ι post sermones quosdam

lectos in which he was not mentioned3 these sermones cannot have been
the First Book of the Epistles‚ where Augustus is frequently referred to;
they must have been Epist. 2, 2-the bare mention of Augustus’ name
iu vs. 48 does not stand in the way of this-and this Epistle. The

‘ inference from the statement of Suetonius would therefore be that this

Epistle was written before Epist. 2, ις that is, in the period between
the publication of the F irst Book and the writing of the Carmen Saecu-
lare, between 19 or 20 nc. and 17 nc. Fortunately the character of
the Epistle is such that a more precise date is not necessary to its in·
