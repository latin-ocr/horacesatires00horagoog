1⁴9· notas: e'.e., Homer treats
his subject-matter as already in
part known to his hearerS, asin
fact it was.

150. tractata: handled, treated.
The Latin construction here is
clumsy and should not be used in
translating.

151. mentitur: e'.e.,uresfictzbns.
—veris falsa: this reflects the
belief that the Homeric story was
in the main historical.

153-177· ‘The poet must make
his characters consistent and life-
like and, in particular, must no-
tice the characteristioe os different
periods in life.'

153. tuz the poet, as in 128.
The abrupt line introduces a new
thought, in this case wholly with-
out transition. From this point

becomes more prominent.

154. plausoris: to be taken
closely with manentis,· ‘if you
want your audience to stay and to
listen with pleasure up to the end?

155. ros plaudite: the formula
with which the plays ended3 some-
times vos valete et plaudete. It is
spoken sometimes by the corn·
pany (grex),sometimes by the last
actor, and sometimes (Plaut. Trin,
M.G.‚ and all the plays of Ter·
enee) there is no indication of the
speaker. There is no allusion
elsewhere to a canter, nor can
anything be inserted from this
passage in regard to the usage in
the time of Terence.

156. notandi: ‘observed with
care)

157· decor: that which is suited
(decens, vs. 92) to each period,
not merely the good qualities3 cf.
170 ff.

The description oi the different
Ages of Man was probably tradi·
tional. In Terence there are only
two, adulescens and senem Aris-
totle (Rhet. 2, 12) has three3 Shak-
spere (As you Like lt, 2, 7) has
seven. Though Horace intro·
duces this asa part os his advice
to the dramatist, he does not con·
fine himself strictly to the possi-
