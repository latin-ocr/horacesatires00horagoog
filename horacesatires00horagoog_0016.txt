INTRODUCHON

neglected. The satires which followed the admission of Horace
to the friendship of Vergil and Varius and Maecenas need no

specific comment beyond that which will be found in the special
¹ introductions; they are not the work of an obscure beginner,
but of a man tempered by association with men of taste, mel-
lowed by friendly recognition, and already master of an easy
style and a sane and humorous philosophy of life.

His choice of satire as a means of expression is explained by
Horace in Sat. 1, ro, 40-47; he says that other fields—comedy,
tragedy, the epic, the bucolic—were already occupied, and that
satire alone seemed open to him. But this explanation is not to
be taken seriously; the causes which determined his choice were ,
deeper, partly in his own temperament, partly in the conditions
of his time. He was by nature an observet of men3 he found in
the interplay of character and circumstance a spectacle of con-

of the teachings of his father and of his own habitual altitude,
however humorous the application which he makes of it, is
essentially true. To a man of such a habit of mind satire, in
the sense which Horace gave to the word, as a good-natured
commentary, that is, upon the follies and upon the virtues, too,
of the men with whom he lived, was the most natural vehicle of
expression. In so far as he was inclined toward more serious
and emotional expression, he used at first the half-lyrical form
of the EpodeS, and the absence of the more profound feelings
from the Satires is to be explained in part by the fact that they
found another outlet in such poems as Epodes 4, 7, 9, and 16.
But these strongly emotional verses look backward to thie tem-
pestuous past; they express the attitude of the obscure and
defeated republican, struggling with circumstances and not yet
in harmony with himself, and their subjects belong rather to
the period of strife than to the new era upon which Rome was
entering. The Augustan Age, precisely because it checked the
vigorous public activities of the preceding period and turned
