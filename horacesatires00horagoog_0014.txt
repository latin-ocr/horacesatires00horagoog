INTRODUCHON

Brutus came to Athens in me late summer of 44, on his way to
assume the governorship of Macedonia and Asia Minor, Horace
abandoned his studies and accompanied him with the uominal
title ofm'bunus militum. Of the two years that intervened be
tween the death of Caesar and the battle of Philippi, in 42, there
is no record except me rather juvenile seweuth satire of the

First Book. It is probable that his fafflerhad died and that the
property had been lost, perhaps confiscated3 for when Horace
returned to Rome in 41, he was obliged to support himself by Ι
taking a clerkship'in the treasury department; here he began
his career as a writer. ⁵

Behind these bare facts of his early life the temperament and
character of Horace were taking shape. The story has in it
so much that is modern that we are perhaps in danger of forcing
the analogias, yet the outlines of the process are clear. Horace
was a country boy, trained in the prudent traditions of a quiet
life; his father desired for him the rise in station which he had
himself only partially achieved, and sought it by means 0f a
higher education and more stimulating associations than a re
mote village could afford. From the studies of the university
the young man was plunged into the floods of civil war, following
the leadership of the half-mystical and wholly romantic Brutus.
He returned to Rome a pardoned rebel; the cause which he
sti-ll believed to have been the cause of liberty was lost3 his hopes
of advancement in public life were at an end3 his father was
dead, his friends scattered, his property gone. Obscure, disap
pointed, perhaps alittle embittered, he was to begin life over
again. If this young man seems a different person from the Hor-
ace whom we associate with graceful love poems and me doctrine
of the golden mean, it is only because we accept the result
without following the process which led to it. For the two
are identical; there is no break in the development; indeed,
it is out of precisely such material that the mellow and penetrat-
ing commentator upon life is made, when success and recogni-
