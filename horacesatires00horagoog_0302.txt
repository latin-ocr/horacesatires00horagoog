This Epistle is not a letter. In its general form it is not essentially
different from the Satires os the First Book. The only indioetions of
that personal tone which distinguishes a letter from a short essay are
the purely formal address in vs. 1, the two dosing lines, and the possi-
ble allusion to the opinions of Numicius in vs. 31, virtutem verba putas.
These, however, are too slight to produoe the impression ofa letter.
F or this reason it may be surmised that this is one of the earlier of the
¹ Epistles, in which Horace is endeavoring to shape a new form for his
social comments, different from the Lucilian form of the F irst Book and
from the dialogue torm of the Second Book.

ln the substance of the Epistle, however, in the handling ol the
familiar though· about wealth and ambition‚ there is a deeided change.
Horace here writes as one to whom philosophy is areality‚ an actual
and accepted gulde in the affairs of tit . In this respect the Epistle is
quite unlike the earlier work and this element brings it into harmony
with the other writings in this collection.
