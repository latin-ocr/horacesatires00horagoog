There is no allusion in this satire definite enough to fix the date.

The plot ol ground which is the scene had been a burin-place, and was ¹

afterward acquired by Maecenas and used as the site for his palace and
gardens. But the date when he acquired the land is not known. Nor

is it clear that the land is in the possession ol Maecenas either at ¹
the time when the events are represented as occurring orat the'later
time when the garden god tells the story. The spot cannot be thought
of as still in use lor borini, sincethe figure of Priapus stands there, aud,
on the other hand, the gatheriug of bones (vs. 22) and the selection

of the spot by two witches as a place lor incantations is scarcely com· ,
patible with its being a‘private garden. Apparently the events are ³

thought of as having occurred while the transformation from burial- l
place to garden was still incomplete. Verses 14-16 allude to a later ¹

stage, but itis strange that there should be no direct allusion to Mae· ’
cenas, to whom in later satires Horace refers with such evident pride ;

and pleasure‚ il he already owned the land and had built his great ¹
hohheesssldlile evidently belongs in the same period as Epodes ς and 17, l

and seems to be referred to in vss. 47, ς 5 and 77 ol the latter Epode. ¹
But neither of these poems cau be dated with certainty. ln the ,
