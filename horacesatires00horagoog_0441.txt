turns of thought and expression, its perfect phrasing, its easy and mel-
low tone.

On the other side, the substance ol what is said in the Ars Poetica
comes from two different sources. Porphyrion says in his brief intro·
duction that Horace has here gathered the teachings of Neoptolemus,
a rhetorician of the third century, non quidem omnt'a‚sed eminentissima. .
This may very well be correct; it is at any rate clear that Horace is in
· part repeating and applying some of the traditional doctrines oi rhetoric,
in which, as a lifelong student of the art which he practiced, he was
certainly interested. To this source is due the large proportion of
Greek literary history. Of all this it is fair to say that it is interesting
chiefly to studente of the history of rhetoric. But Horace does not
merely repeat traditional doctrine; he also comments upon, it, speaking
with the authority of an older poet addressing a younger generation of
literary men. Our incomplete knowledge of the tendencies of the
period makes it difficult to understand fully the point ol some of his
warnings, but much of it is of universal applicatiom even to modern
conditions. This is the more valuable pan of the Ars poetata, centering,
as it does, upon the necessity of adequate training ior the professional
man of letters. lt is at the same time a proclamation οἱ Horace's own
creed and thus a gulde to the interpretation of all his poetry.
