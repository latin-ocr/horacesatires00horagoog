EPISTVLAE

evellas agro, et melior sit Horatius an res.

Me quamvis Lamiae pietas et eura moratur,

fratrem maerentis rapto de fratre dolentis
insolabiliter, tamen istuc mens animusque

fert et amat spatiis obstantia rumpere claustra.

Rure ego viventem, tu dicis in urbe beatum;

cui placet alterius, sua nimirum est odio sors.

Stultus uterque locum immeritum causatur inique; x
in culpa est animus, qui se non effugit unquam.

Tu mediastinus tacita prece rura petebas

you to a contest, to see whether culiar effect. Cicero (ad Att. 12,
...J-spinas: forweedsin gen· 28, 2, rnaerorem minui, dolorem

both of faults aud of weeds.—res:

the two words, but the distinction
is here unimportant; ntourning,

6. umbe: subjectlve gen.; gn'eving.

‘lamia's affection and distress‚'
further explained by the next line.
[The single case of an objective
gem, deum pictas, in a fragment
of Naevius, by no means justifies
the taking of Lamiae as an ob·

suij. is the proper mode with

quamvis, but the confusion with .

quamquam had already gone so
far that Horace uses the indic.
more often than the subjunctive.
— Carm. 1, 26 is addressed to L.
Aelius Lamia and he is referred
to in Carm. 3, 17. He became
consul in 3 Aa). Evidently he
was one of Horace's most valued
friends.

fratre and the assonance of mae·

8. istuc: ‘to the place where
you are,‘ to the country.

9. amat: longs5 so, with infin,
Carm. 3, 9, 24.-The figure in
the rest of the line is taken from
chariot racing3 chustra are the
bars which kept the horses within
the carceres until the race was
started and which may therefore
be said obstare spatiis, to ‘stand
in the way of the racecourse'

rr. alterius: sc. sors. The
