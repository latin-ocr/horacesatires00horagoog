Natura fieret laudabile carmen, an arte,

nec rude quid prosit video ingenium3 alterius sic

Qui studet optatam cursu contingere metam,

401. hos: the dmm& vatibus,
of whom Orpheus and Amphion
were the earliest examples.

402. Tyrtaeus: the poet who
wrote war songs and marching
songs for the SpartanS, in the
seventh century B.c. — mares ε as

must contribute to make a good
poet — though 1 know that this is
not the accepted doctrine.'

408. natura . . . an arte: this
was an old question, usually an-
swered as here by saying that
both. are necessary. Cf„ eg, Cic.
pro Arch. 7, 15.

409. studium: = ars. —venaz
of precious metaIS, as in modern
usage.

410. rude . . .
tura sine arte.

411. amice: i.e.‚ ‘it is amistake
