comedy. — heri: the pronuncia·
tion of the last letter was so
indistinct that the word was writ-
ten sometimes lteri, sometimes
ltere.

3. ‹le medio die: the dinner be-
gan before the usual hour, which
was three o'clock or later, as it
was to be a formal affair. The
Roman custom iu this respect
was the opposite of ours.

4. fuerit melius: mr'izi braeost,
⁴1 am enjoying myself,' is a com-
mon colloquialism3 cf. Sat.v 2, 2,
120.

5. iratum ventrem: ci. latran-
timomachum, Sat. 2, 2, 18. The
question is ironical, as if the object
of a formal dinner was to satisfy
a natural hunger.

6—9. Our knowledge oi Roman
dinner customs is imperfect, the
fashions changed from time to
time, and this description is meant
to be only a series of allusions.
lt is therefore quite impossible to
arrange the manu or even to de·
cide whether this course consti-
tuted the gustatio (promulsis) 3 the
relishes served with the boar would
indicate that it did3 the fact that

no drinlr (mulsum) is mentioned
would, however, be a strange
omission.

of. leni. . ‚Austro captus: not
predicate with suitr ‘one ol the
first things was a Lucanian boar,
killed, as the host said, when a
mild southerly wind was blowing.'
The Lucanian boar was especially
prized and the state of the weather
at the time the animal was killed
was supposed to affert the flavor
oi the meat3 cf. Sat. 2, 2, 32 ff.
and the modern superstitious
about the ‘dark of the moon'-
cenae pater: heis called also eras
(vss. 16, 43), ipse (23), parochus
(36), and convivator (73), as well
as Nasidienus (1, 75, 84) and
Rufus (58). ’

Η. acria: introducing the
whole list and repeated in qualia
. . . stomachum. The relishes
are only partly in use now nor is
the precise identification of them
at all important: ‘rape, lettuce,
radisheS, skirret, fish-pickle, and
burnt tartar from Coan wine.’
These were arranged around (cir-
cum) the boar, perhaps ou the
same platter.
