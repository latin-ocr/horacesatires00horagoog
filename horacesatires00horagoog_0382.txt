An Epilogue to the collection of Epistles‚ written in the year 20, after
the other poems were collected for publication.

‘Yon are eager to see the world, my book, like a young slave who
seeks to escape from the house of a good master. Go, then, and meet
your fate; you will, I think, have some readers but I do not predict for
you an immortality of favor.

‘While the favor lasts, tell your readers what I am, a freedman's son
who feels himself now coming to middle age.l

This poem is, on the one side, an expression of the writer's hopes
audieus, as he sends a new book out into the world. itis done, as
one would expect from Horace, without flourish of trumpets3 he is
quite aware of the fact that the book has merim, but he knows also that
itis not the greatest book that was ever written. On this side the
poem might be compared with Catullus's address to his new book, with
Ovid's‘ Tristia 1, 1 and Martial, 1, 3. On the other side, this epistle is
like the biographies which were often appended to standard editions,
much as the Vita by Suetonius is preserved in the Mss. of Horaoe's

complete works. The brief ‘Life’ of the author gives his birth and ’

origin (20), his rise in life (21-23), his appearance and character
(24-25), and his age (πό-28), as such things are given in biographies ,
of the standard form. Propertius (r, 22) and Ovid (Amor. 3, 1 ς) have
followed the same custom.
