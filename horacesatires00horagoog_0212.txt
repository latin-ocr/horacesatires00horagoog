The date of this satire is fixed by vss. 62 ff. The phrase tellure
marique magnus would not have been used in the years just before
Actium, when it was increasingly apparent that the supremacy by sea
was still to be decided. After Actium there was a general expectation
that Octavius would carry out the project of his uncle for a war of con·
quest in the East and it is to such expectations that Parthis horrendus
refers. The satire was written soon aster the battle of Actium, late in
31 or early in 30.

The subject-matter is the practice of secking legacies. To treat this
as a profession, however, is to take satire too seriously; it was a social
evil, like free divorce or political bribery, which the satirist ridicules by
assuming an ironical seriousness. Thecustom of leaving legacies, often
small, but not infrequently of substantia] amount, to many friends was
already common in the Ciceronian period. lt was to be expected that
the custom would lead to the cultivation of friendships in the hope of a
legacy and the tendency was strengthened by the large increase of
wealth in the hands of men who did not know how to use it. Such
men, often of the freedman class, sometimes without family connections,
would be especially open to the flattering approaches of persons of
higher position.

The satire is a continuation, in burlesque, of a scene in the Odyssey,
rr, 90 ff. The shade of the Theban seer, Tiresias, meets Odysseus in
the lower world and at his request tells him how he may secure his
return to ithaca aud how he may summon the shade of his mother.
After this interview the seer returns (vss. 150 f.) to the home of Hades.
At this point Horace interjects the conversation which for'ms this satire.
The selection of the venerable prophet of Thebes .to give advice such
as this is as happy as the selection of Trebatius in Sat. 2, r, and Odys·
