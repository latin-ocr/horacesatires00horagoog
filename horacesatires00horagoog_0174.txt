2, 3, 1] HORATI Ι

The synonyms for t'nsanus collected by Teuffel (furiosus, excors, delirus,
amens, enuntia versatus, demens, cerritus, comnwtus, commotae mutet,
mentem concussus, male tutae neentis, putidi cerebri) are evidence of the
pains taken to avoid monotony.

As to the underlying motive of the satire, it seems probable that the .
accusations of idleness in the opening lines were not without founda-
tion. After the publication of the First Book there was probably a
period in which Horace was disinclined to go on with precisely the
same kind of writing and was perhaps turning toward lyric poetry.
During this time of hesitation he may well have seemed to be occupied
with his farm (307 f.) and to have abandoned his literary ambitions.
To the doubts of his friends and the criticisms ofhis enemies this long
and carefully constructed satire was intended to be a reply. At the
same time it is, even more distinctly than Sat. 2, 2, an attempt to touch
the follies of mankind with a lighter touch. The burlesque of Stoic
formalism and solemnity runs through the whole and is in many places
worked out in detail, so that the satire might well be taken to be a satire
upon that sect. On the other hand, however, the absurdities and follies
which are the subject-matter are equally the objects of attack, but they
are made ridiculous by exaggeration rather than reproved. lf the first
part of the sermon of Stertinius (vss. 82-157) be compared with Sat. 1, 1,
which deals with the same subject, the difference in manner will be
apparent. There is in this satire none of the direct argument which
gives a serious tone to Sat. 1, 1 3 the sermon of Stertinius is a series of
absurd illustrations,—Staberius, Aristippus, thesenseless miser, Orestes,
Opimius, - which ridicule avarice by presenting it in its extremest forms.
In short, the genial raillery of Horace is here directed by turns upon
the preacher, upon the congregation, and upon the satirist himself.
