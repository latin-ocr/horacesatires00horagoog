Tun· Epistles were written, with perhaps a single exception,
between 2 3 rae. and 17. No event of Horace's life during this
period is on record, but from occasional references in his writ-

partly in Rome, more often on his farm, and sometimes in the
winter months at Baiae or in Southem Italy. His circle of
friends was large and included many men of high character and

letters show, he was on terms of friendly intercourse with the
younger men of all sets and he seems, indeed, to have made
a deliberate effort to cultivate and maintain such relations. His
own position in literature was assured. There is evidence,
it is true, that he was not beyond the reach of criticism; the
tone of Epist. r, 19 shows that; and it is possible that the first 1
reception of the Odes had been less favorable than he had
hoped it would be. Undoubtedly, also, the school of the docti,
the poets and critics who preferred the more ornate manner
of the Alexandrian literature, was at this time strong in popular
favor. But, with all allowance for the difference between con-
temporary judgments and the judgment of posterity, it is quite
