SERMONES [r‚ 3

my faults are as bad as his.” No, you do not, 3ηά your sels-satisfied
attitude is a proper subject for a satire,

‘Your habit of criticism brings its natural result, that others criticize
you, and both you and they, seizing upon some trifliug fault, fail to see
the finer and nobler qualities and, still worse, make no effort to correct
your own faults. ·

‘l wish that we might rather be as blind to the faults of a friend as
a lover is to the defects in the face of his mistress or, if see them we
must, might treat thern with the indulgent teuderness of a father toward
his child, interpreting bluntness as frankness and a hot temperas only
an excess of high spirit.

‘But we follow just the opposite course and turn good qualities into
faults, modesty into stupidity, prudence into trickiness. A fairer judg-
ment would show us that virtues are more common than vices 3ηά
would teach us to exchauge pardon rather than censure·

‘A reasonable philosophy for 3 world of faulty meu should not be
over-strict. To break a friendship for some trifling breach of good
manners is to lose all sense of proportion between crime and penalty.

‘The Stoics, to be sure, teaeh in their paradoxical way that all faults ·
are sins and deserve the heaviest penalty. But this doctrine is repug-
nant to our best feelings and opposed to all that we know of the gradual
evolution oi the moral code. A real understanding of the source of our
moral sense makes it unreasonable to punish the slightest error with
death, as the Stoic says he would do, if he were king. “And how
now, my Stoic friend? Wishing that you were king? l thought

Ι another of your Paradoxes proved that you are aking already·'‘ “ No,

n0, you don't understand. That means a potential king, not 3 king
de [πίσθ’ “ Potential? What's that?” “Why, like Hermogenes,
who doesn't need to be singing all the time to prove that he’s a singer.
Eveu when he isn't singing, he's 3 potential singer. ln the same
way l'm a king, potentially.” “Very well, l won't argue with you, but
Ι don't think much of Your Majesty, hustled by street boys on your
way to the cheap baths. Ι will remain a private citizen and forgive as
Ι hope to be forgiven.'''

lt is not probable that the subject of this satire was suggested by
any particular set 0f circumstances. Roman society was censorious,
and Horace was himself an objectos criticism, but this is neither a
satire, in the proper sense, noran argument in selfdefence. lt is a

broadly human plea for generosity toward one's friends. The treat-
ment of the Stoics is not to be taken seriously, 3ηά it would not be fair
to press too far the obvious modern analogius.
