HORATI

Hic simul accepit patrimoni mille talenta,
edicit, piscator uti, pomarius, auceps,
unguentarius, ac Tusci turba impia vici,
cum scurris fartor, cum Velabro omne macellum,

230 mane domum veniant. Quid tum l Venere frequentes.
Verba iacit leno: ‘Quicquid mihi, quicquid et horum
cuique domi est, id crede tuum, et vel nunc pete vel

cras!

Accipe quid contra iuvenis responderit aequus:
‘In nive Lucana dormis ocreatus, ut aprum

235 cenem ego ; tu piscis hiberno ex aequore verris ;
segnis ego, indignus qui tantum possideam: aufer!

andans. Apictureof the Rake's
Progress, not inferior in its irony
and its real moral power to Ho-
garth's engravings. The effec-
tiveness ol it lies in the artifice of
representing the essentials of a
spendthriit‘s career as if the events
had actually occurred in this bare
form. For Horace does not mean
that such a gathering as this took
place or that these words were
uttered‚ but that this is what the
whole story really amounts to, if
we go below the sursace. There
is a grave irony in the lines and
the burlesque ol the Stoic manner
is dropped.

aayff. edicit: proclaim by his
altitude and conduct. Cf. Sat. 2,
2, 51 for a similar, ironical use
of this formal word-piscator,
pomarius, . . . : purveyors of va·
rious luxuries—Tusci . . . rici: a
street leading from the Forum
toward the n'ver, one ol the dis-

reputable quarters ol the city.—
ocurris: a scurra wasa haugen-on
of some richer man, a piofessional
diner·out who lived by his wits. —
fartor: perhaps the mange-make.
— Velabro: a street opening from
the Tuscus ortus, a center os the
trade in various kinds of pro·
visione—Quid tum: what next?

2³1· leno: the procurer is the
suitable spokesman.

²³³· aequus: sair-minded3 for
their valuable services he proposes
to make a fair retuso.

²³4· Lucana: the boars of Lu-
cania were especially esteemed for
fond—ocreatus: greaves were
worn to protect the hunter from·
the tusks of the boar. These de·
tails of hardship and danger carry
on the irony of aequus.

²³⁵· hiberno: cf. Sat. 2, 2, rof.

²37· deciens: sc. centena milia
sestertium, a ntr'llion, oi course an ’
absurd sum.
