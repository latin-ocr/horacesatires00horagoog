INTRODUCTION

the idylls of Theocritus, that is, employed it for purposes
different from those ior which it was used by its originators.
The connected group of Alcaic odes' which stand at the begin-
ning of me Third Book would then represent a modification
in use like that which is represented in Vergil’s Fourth Eclogue.
Such an adaptation of me Alcaic stanza to new uses is in fact
a modification and development oi the artistic form, less in
amount than Horace had undertaken in the development oi
the Lucilian satire, but similar in kind and revealing the same
underlying artistic purpose.

Horace’s career, then, as an artist, had been, up to the year
23 rae„ that of a man whose interest had been in the shaping
oi given poetic forms to new uses. Insatire the modifications
had been deliberate and oi considerable effect, so that he was

in this field almost a creator3 in lyric poetry the adaptations
had been oi narrower scope, yet not without influence upon the
poetic form. He was now to take up a third form of literature,

the Epistle.

The history oi the epistle as a literary form is not yet wholly
clear. In early Latin literature it was used chiefly for practical
ends. Cato published letters addressed to his son, probably
oi a didactic character, and there existed in Cicero's time a
collection of letters by Cornelia to her sons, the Gracchi.
Cicero’s own letters have come down to us a most interesting
collection, but they are real letters and can have been only
’ in an incidental way models for Horace. In'verse the historical
sequence is even less clear. The custom ol dedicating a poem
to an individual by a direct address, as Horace inscribes his
first satire to Maecenas, is an approach to the epistolary iorm3 =

tius addresses Memmius at intervals in the de Remm Natura
and the occasional address to the Pisones in the Ars Poetica.
Some oi the poems of Catullus are epistolary in form and even
in substance. But from these scattered approximatione to the
