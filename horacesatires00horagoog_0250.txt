HORATI

si memini, Varius; cum Servilio Balatrone
Vibidius, quas Maecenas adduxerat umbras ;
Nomentanus erat super ipsum, Porcius inira,
ridiculus totas simul absorbere placentas;
Nomentanus ad hoc, qui, siquid forte lateret,
indice monstraret digito: nam cetera turba,
nos inquam, cenamus avis, conchylia, piscis
longe dissimilem noto celantia sucum,

ut vel continuo patuit, cum passeris atque

αι. Varius: cf. Sat. r, 5, 403

The name Porcius is coined from

1, ro, 44, and often3 one ol porcum cf. the next verse-super

Horace's and Vergil’s closest
friends. There is probably some
little joke in si rnemz'm'.

22. Maecenas: he was in the
place of honor, the locus consu·
laris, numbered 6 in the diagram.
-umbres: persons whom the
chief guest might bring with him,
without special invitation from
the host. So Horace, inviting a
friend, says (Epist. 1, 5, 28), locus
est et pluribus umbris. Men who
came in such a way would ordina-
rily be of lower rank, and Servilius
and Vibidius were evidently scur-
rae (see note on Sat. 2, 3, 229),
who were expected to furnish
entertainment for the others. In
fact all the conversation reported
(vss. 34, 65 ff, 80 ff.) comes from
thern or from the host and his
own scurrae.

23. Nomentanus, Porcius: two
parasites of the host. Nomen-
tanus is not the spendthrift men-
tioned in other satires (1, 1‚102;
r,8,11; 2,1,22; 2, 3, 175, 224).

ipsum: i.e. Nasidienus had given
the bost's place (no. 7) to his
more fluent parasite, sor the reason
given in vs. 25.

24. totas simul: all at once.
Various kinds of buffoonery like
this are alluded to in Plautus as
practiced by parasites. <

25 f. ad hoc: also in Sat. 2, 1,
36, to introduce a clause of pur-
pose—lateret: pass annoticed by
the gneus-indice digito: ie.
he should not only speak of it,
but also point to it-cetera turba:
the instruction was obviously given
to Maecenas and the others were a
mere turba, left for the most part
uninstructed as to the nature oi
the iood before thern.

²7· inquam: not strengthen-
ing the previous statement, but
explaining it; we, [mean.

28 ff. celantia: nent, agreeing
with the three nouns of different
gendes—noto: sc. suco‚· dat.
after dzssz'milem.-vel: in fact.
-pesseris: flat-fishf the name
