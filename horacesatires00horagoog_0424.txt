HORATI

caelatumque novem Musis opus l ’ Adspice primum,
quanto cum fastu, quanto molimine circum-

spectemus vacuam Romanis vatibus aedem,

mox etiam, si forte vacas, sequere et procul andi,

quid ferat et quare sibi nectat uterque coronam.
Caedimur et totidem plagis consumimus hostem

lento Samnites ad lumina prima duello.

ably the most admired form of
poetry. Horace did not himself
attempt it. The allusion here is
almost certainly to the elegiae poet
Propertius. He was a member of
the Maecenas circle, yet heis no·
where mentioned by Horace, who
mentions so many literary friends.
The suspicion that this silence cov-
ers some hostility is strengthened
by the great differences in tempera·
ment and in literary ideals. Com-
mentators have therefore found
veiled allusions to Propertius in
various passages (Sat. 1, 10, 18,
simius irte‚· Sat. 1, 9) 3 this is the
most distinct and probable.

92. caelatum: the poem is
praised in terms which would be
used of a highly ornamented work
of art-novem Musis: dat. of
agent with cadalum,- the poem
is so perfect that all the Muses
must have aided in the writing of
it.-adspice: the two poets are

, pictured standing before the tem·

ple of Apollo, exchanging compli-
ments.

93-94. fastu: pride-moli-
mine: a rather rare word, witha
suggestion· of vastness and effort

from its connection with umber,
nram,- an air os amporam. —
circum-spectemus: a word is run
over from one line to the next
in' a few other places3 Sat. 1, 2,
62; 2, 3, 1173 ΑΡ. 424. There

may be here an intentional hit at ¹

the dignified air of the poets. -
vacuam: the temple library was
‘open to Roman poets,' as if in
expectation of their coming. Cf.
Epist. 2, r, 216 f.

⁹5· si. . . vacas: ‘ifyouare
quite at leisure‚' and have nothing
better to ‹lo—nqueo: to the
hall where the poets are to read
their verses to each other. No

definite place is thought of 3 the ¹

two poets‚ having looked proudly
at the library where they hope
that their poems are to be pre·
served, pass on to a hall where
they hold a recitatio.

9⁶· sibi nectat: each is weav-
ing a chaplet for himself by com-
plimenting the other in order to
be complimented in turn.

⁹7-98· A condensed compari-
son3 the two poets are like two
gladiators and exchange poems as
the gladiators exchange blows. -
