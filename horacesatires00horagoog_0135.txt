sannovas [1,10

In the fourth satire Horace had defended himself against the charge
that he was malicious and was seeking notoriety. The reply was in
general direct and convincing, but in the course of his argument he
happened to say (vss. 6-13) that his prototype, Lucilius, had written
too profusely and with too little attention to finish. This chance re
mark -which is abundantly justified by the extant fragments of
Lucilius—had brought upon him some censure from that school of

literary critics in Rome whose cardinal doctrine was the excellence
of the early Latin poetry, and ,had at the same time exposed him to the
less sincere attacks of others who seized the opportunity to renew their
personal and unfriendly criticisms. This satire is a reply to both
classes. To the serious admirers of early Latin poetry he· replies with
a serious discussion of the nature and causes of the defects of Lucilius
and with candid praise of his merits. To the little clique of personal
enemies he scarcely replies at all, brushing them aside with contemptu-
ous brevity and twitting them (17-19) with their ignorance of the very
poetry about which they were pretending to be solicitous,
Pretixed to the text of this satire in some Mss. are eight verses: -

Lucili, quam sis mendosus, teste Catone,

defensore tuo, pervincum, qui male factos

emendare parat versos3 hoc lenius ille, =

quo vir est melior, longe subtilior illo,

qui multum puer et loris et funibus udis

exhortatus, ut asset opem qui ferre poetis ’

antiquis posset contra fastidia nostra,

grammaticorum edultum doctissimus. Vt redeam illuc:

These lines contain Horatian phrases (cf. lorti et funibus with
Epod. 4, 3, Epist. 1, 16, 47) and opinions (cf. vs. 7 with Epist. 2, 1,
18 ff.); the reference to P. Valerius Cato, though not exactly identioel
with the statement in Suetondt Gram. 2, is a similar bit of gram·
matioel tradition3 the satirical allusion in vss. 5 ff. is obscure and con·
tradictory, but comes evidently from the same school of literary and
’ personal gossip3 the phrasing is stili (hoc lenius ille, ille and illo refer-
ring to different persons, the apposition of dectnszmus to qur), and the
joining of the lines to vs. r of the satire by the words ut redeam illuc is
very awkward. These facts all point to one conclusion, that ,the verses
were written by a grammarian who saw in the abruptness of nempe dixi
an opportunity to perpetuate a bit of his own learned satire by prefixing
it to the text of Horace· '
