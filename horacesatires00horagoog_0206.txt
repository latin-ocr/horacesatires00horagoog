repeats the teachings which he had learned from the door-keeper ol
Crispinus (νε. 45)· Such machinery of the satirical form is not to be
taken seriously3 in Sat. 2, 7 it is plainly a mere joke and the Damasip-
pus-Stertinius relation in Sat. 2, 3 serves only to give a background for
the parody os Stoic preaching. Os the various identifications of Catius
the only one which has both plausibility and point is the one proposed
by Mauso and revived by Palmer, that the name is a disguise of Matius,
the friend oi Cicero, Caesar, Trebatius and Augustus. But, in fact, the ,
precise identification of either Catius or the mysterious auctor is of no
more importance than the precise determination os the date ofcomposi·
tion. The satire contains in'itsell its own best commentary. lt is a
bit ol humorous and not unsriendly irony, directed primarily against
some person whose name is ostentatiously withheld and, more broadly‚
against the science and art ol gastronomy. So far as there is any per-
sonality in it, it is of a kind which would be especially understood and
appreciated by Horace's intimate friends, and the satire belongs, in this
respect, to the same class as Sat. 1, 9 and Sat. 2, 8. In all three there
is the note of intimacy and it is not at all impossible that the learning
ot' this satire is a parody of gastronomic conversations which Horace
had heard at the table oi Maecenas.
