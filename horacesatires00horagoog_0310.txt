1, 7, 1] HORATI

· on his little island. So it is with me 3 Rome is too big for me, and 1
am too small for Rome. Let me tell you a story. Philippus, the
lawyer, once made acquaintance with a small tradesman and, partly for
his own amusement, iuduced him to give up his life in Rome and turn
sarmer. The natural result followed; the amateur iarmer came to
utter grief. As he looked at the ruins, he saw his mistake, galloped
back to Philippus and begged to be allowed to return the gift. The
moral is'that every man must go his own way.'

This Epistle was written late in August or early in September.
Horace had left Rome in midsummer, promising to return after a short
stay in the mountains. He had, however, stayed for a month, and
Maecenas, detained in Rome,¹ had written him, asking him to corne
back and reminding him of his promise and probably of his obligation
to his benefactor. To that letter Horace replies in this Epistle. The
persona! tone is strong in vss. 1-13, 24-28, 34-39, but the greater part
of the Epistle consists of the four stories which are woven into it, the
story ol the Calabrian, vss. 14-19, of the fox, 29-33, of Telemachus,
40-43, and the long story of Philippus, 46-95. The effect of the intro·
duction of this large amount of impersonal material is to make the
Epistle read like a Satire. And a comparison with Sat. 1, 6 and

’ Sat. 2, 6 will show that Horace has here, in treating a serious subject,
returned in part to his earlier form. ⁴ The fusion, however, of the two
elements is carried out with great skill, and this Epistle is justly re-
garded as one of the poet's most finished productioris.

But the personal aspect of it is even more interesting than the artistic
form. The position wasone of real difficulty. lt is handled with
admirable independence and candor and with most friendly considera·
tion for the feelings of Maecenas. Undoubtedly, as the fact of publica·
tion shows, it was received by him with appreciation and with generous
cordiality.
