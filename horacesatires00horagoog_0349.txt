vss. 1-16; Horace cannot write impersonally ol his Sabine farm. And
vss. 17-18 have undoubtedly some special reference to the circumstances
ol Quinctius. But the latter part of the Epistle is general, a sort of
testatemeut, in Horace's words and manner, of the second Stoic Para-
dox. This is quoted by Cicero (Parad. 2): ὅτι αὐτάρκης ἡ ἀρετὴ πρὸς
εὐδαιμονίαν, in quo sit vr‘rlus, ei nihil deesse ad beate vivendum, and is

death as the ultima linea ln the style, also, as well as in the sub-
stance, there is an adoption oi Stoic teaching by means of short sen·
tences and lively bits ol dialogue. No careful reader os the Satires
will be surprised to find that Horace, in his later study ol philosophy,
sometimes accepts the Stoic doctrines 3 even in the earlier writings it
is possible to see, underneath the llippancy with which he meets the
sonnalism oi the Stoics,a considerable measure ol sympathy with the
essence of their teaching. ’
