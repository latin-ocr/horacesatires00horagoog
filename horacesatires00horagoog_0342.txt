Ol the date of this Epistle it can only be said that it was written
after 23, when Antonius Musa introduced the bold-water cure, and per-
haps in fulfilment of the intention expressed in Epist. 1, 7, 11, to spend
a winter on the southern coast. The person addressed is a Numonius
Vale, ot' whom, individually‚ nothing is known exoept what is implied
in the letter. But there are references in inscriptions and on coins to
Numenii, who were ot a somewhat distinguished family in Lucania.

⁴ Tell me all about your part of the country, Vala (for my doctor has
ordered me to give up Baiae and take to the told-water business3 1
don't like it, but 1 suppose l must do as he says); how about the
bread? and the water? (I’ll attend to the wine mysell.) And what
can l get in the way of game and sea foodi Oh, yes‚ l haven't tor·
gotten my own sermons. But you know the story of Maenius, how be
used to preach against prodigals, but, when be had a chance, used to
return with gusto to his prodigal life again. So Ι preach simplicity
when my bank account is low, but Ι also know a good dinner when Ι
see it.'

A genuine letter, asking for information and expecting an answen
But the dry questions are interrupted by humorous parentheses which
explain the reason for the letter and set forth the cheerful frame of mind
