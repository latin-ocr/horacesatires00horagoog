The precise date of this satire cannot be fixed. The allusion in vs.
23 may be either to Sat. 2, 2 or to the second half of Sat. 2, 6, and vs.
28, Romae rus optas, may also refer to Sat. 2, 6, 59 ff. These indica·
tions point in a general way to alate date.

The form is the characteristic form of this book, which is used also
in Satires 3, 4, and 8. The main body of the satire is a discourse
addressed to Horace himself, which is introduced and then brought to
a close ογ bits of dialogue suited to the subject and to speaker and
listener. The resemblance to the third satire is particularly close3
both are on the feast of the Saturnalia, in both Horace is interrupted
by the intrusion of the speaker and in turn interrupts the speaker before
the main discourse is reached (3, 26 and 31; 7, 21 t), and both close
with an outbreak of anger on Horace’s part.

In substance also this satire is much like the third. Tbat is a dis
course upon the Stoic Paradox that all men except the philosopher are
insane; this has forits text the other Paradox that all men but the
philosopher are slaves, ἕντι μόνος ὁ σοφὸς ἐλεύθερος, καὶ πᾶς ἄφρων
δοῦλος. This is the subjectos Cicero's Parad. V. and Horace follows
in part the same line of reasoning, using in vss. 89 ff. the illustration
of the lover enslaved by a woman and in vss. 95 ff. the illustration of
the infatuated admirer of works of art, almost precisely as they are
used by Cicero. As in the third satire the preacher upon the insanity
of men is the half-crazy Damasippus, so here the person who discourses
upon the slavery of men is Horace's own slave, Davus, and as Dama·
sippus 'gets his wisdom from Stertinius (and Catius, in the fourth satire,
from an unnamed auctor), so in this satire, with a elever parody, Davus
has learned his philosophy from the door-keeper of the philosopher
Crispinus. The form of Stoic discourse is less distinctly parodied than
in Sat. 3, perhaps only in vs. 83, and it is evident that Horace was less
inclined to burlesque this Paradox than he had been to flout the doc·
trine that all men are insane. The truth that men are the slaves of
their follies and vices is so familiar to us, that we are, in fact, obliged
