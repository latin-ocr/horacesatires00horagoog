LIBER SECVNDVS

1

The date of this Epistle cau be determined with a fair degree of pre·
cision. It is probable that Horace wrote it, in accordance with the

. custom which he had followed in publishing other collections of poems,

after the other EpistleS, 2 and 3 (the Ars Prema), to serve as an intro· ’

duction and to dedicate the whole collection to the person addressed in
this letter. This general probability is supported by a passage in the
Vita of Suetonius: ‘post sermones vero quosdam lectos nullam sui

mentionem habitam ita sit questus: “irasci me tibi scit0, quod non in ¹

plerisque eius modi scriptis mecum potissimum loquaris. Ap vereris ne
Α apud posteros infame tibi sit, quod videaris familiaris nobis esse?”
-² expresseritque eclogam adse cuius initium est cum tot sustineas . . . .’
This story comes immediately after a reference to tbe Carmen Saecu-
lare and the Fourth Book of the Odes. The sermones quosdam and
the cius modi scriptis cannot bave been the Satires, published fifteen
years earlier, and can scarcely have been the First Book of the Epistles,
which had been before the public for some years. These words must

therefore refer to Epist. 2, 2 aud 3, already known to Augustus before

they were formally published. All this falls into proper sequence with

the references to the campaigns of 15-14 n.c.‚ referred to iu vss. ²52· =

253, and points to 14 or 13 nc. as the date of composition.

The course of thought is natural aud easy, shifting from oue aspect ¹

of the subject to another without following a formal scheme. Some
general divisions will be notieed: vss. 5-92‚ the overestimate of early
writers in comparisou with new poetry3 93-117, the historical develop-

ment which has resulted in the present situation3 118-138‚ the contri· j
butions of the poet to the welfare of society3 139-213, the special ³
disadvantages and defects of dramatic writing3 214—250, the good influ· ’
enee of the patronage of Augustus upon literaturess 250-270, Horace's ,

own relation to the patronage of Augustus.

Iu the Second Book of the Epistles the form of versified letter is
somewhat changed. The three Epistles are all long and their very
length destroys the illusiou of the letter form3 they-necessarily become
essays, addressed, it is true, to an individual, but intended for the public
