SERMONES

9

This satire was written between 38 and 35 nc, later than the first
group, Satires 2, 7, and 8, but before Satire 1 and probably before ro.
There is no allusion which makes a more precise dating possible and,
as is usually me case where distinct allusions are lacking, there is
nothing in the satire which would gain in interpretation if a more pre·
cise date could be fixed.

In form the satire is an account of a morning walk in which Horace
was joined by a mere acquaintance, who desired to cultivate a closer
intimacy with him, in order, as finally appeared, to secure through him
an introduction to Maecenas. Various attempts to shake him off were
unsuccessful and an appeal to a passing friend was without effect, until
chance intervened to save the poet. In grace and lightness of tone the
satire is equaled only by some of the odes. The struggle between
politeness and the desire to be free, the humorous consciousness of the
joke upon himself, the happily conceived dramatic form, reaching a
climax in the encounter with Fuscus-all these make it unnecessary
to look for an underlying purpose. But a secondary motive was
doubtless the opportunity which the story afforded of returning to the
theme of the sixth satire and of showing again how ill-founded was
the suspicion that Horace was seeking social advancement through his

acquaintance with Maecenas. ἴ
