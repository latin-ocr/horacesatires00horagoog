INTRODUCTION

epistolary type we are not able to form an accurate conception
oi any models that Horace may have had beiore him or even
to be sure that he had such models at all.

The artistic problem, however, is clear. It was to unite two
elements, the personal and the public, into a barmonious whole,
that is, to preserve a measure ol personality and individuality
and a certain degree oi spontaneity, and' at the same time to
introduce a considerable element oi a kind that would be inter·
’ esting to the general reader. The two are to some extent
antagonistic. The easy confidence which characterizes the best
private letters is so delicate that it almost surely disappears
n it is known to the writer that the letter is to be read by others
than the person addressed. Yet if this disappears entirely, the
epistle is a letter only in form. In the solution of this problem,
Horace has gone from one side to the other, as circumstances
led him, allowing first one, then the other, clement to predomi-
nate. The invitation to dinner (1, 5) addressed to Torquatus
is so personal and natural that this may well have been a real
letter for a real purpose, put into verse form ior the mere pleas-
ure oi the writer and for the compliment which it paid to the
recipient. 'The same thing is true ol 1, 9, introducing Septimius
to Tiberius. One oi the three Epistles to Maecenas (ι, 7) is
extremely personal, both to the writer and to the recipient, so
much so that it seems almost too confidential ior publication,
yet it contains some oi Horace’s best stories and is in parts not
distinguishable irom Sat. 2, 6. In others, 1, 33 1, 113 1, 1²3
1, 15, the situation oi the recipient or the writer is made the
occasion ,ior comments equally interesting to the general public;
in r, 3 this has been done with special success, and the two
elements are so harmoniously blended that it is impossible to
tell whether this is really a letter, sent as is implied, or an
Epistle written on the model oi a personal letter. At the other
extreme, 1, 16 opens with a description oi the farm, but runs
off into a poem which has nothing oi the tone oi a letter in it,
