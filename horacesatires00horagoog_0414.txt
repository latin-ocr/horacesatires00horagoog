difficulty oi supposing that Horace twice publicly announced his inten-
tion oi giving up lyrioel poetry‚ makes the earlier date, 20-18 s.c., more
probable.

For the young Julius F lonrs, see Introd. to Epr'st. 1, 3. l·le was still
in the suite os Tiberius and had apparently been long absent from
Rome.

‘Did you ever buy a slave, my dear Florus, and find yourself pre-
vented from‘complaining ol his faults by the fact that the dealer had
expressly mentioned them? Then you must not complain oi not
hearing from me, tor I warned you that 1 never answer letters. And in
spite os this, you call on me for more Odes! Do you remember that
story os the soldier of Lucullus? Some thies stole his savings and in a
· rage he went off and stormed a onstle and got honor and more money.
But when the general, with most flattering words, invited him to lead
another storming party, he declined with thanks and advised the gen·
eral to get some other man who had just lost his purse. That is just
my attitude. l lost my purse at Philippi and, in a rage, l stormed
the castle oi poetry. But once is enough: lam taking my ease now.
, There are plenty os reasons for not writing. ln the first place, you all
ask for different things. And then, how canone write in Rome, where '
all is confusion? Nor, sor another reason, do l like the mutual admira·
tion clubs, which l should have to join. Auditis no easy matter,
. either, to write really good poetry.

‘The fact is that l have turned, as 1 said once before, from lyrics to
philosophy, and am trying to learn the secrets of true living. l am con-
sidering the nature of possession and how it differs from use and how
transient itis, at the best. l am trying to practice ¹the doctrine of the
Golden Mean and to become both better and happier‚ as I grow
older.'

ln this Epistle‚ as in Epist. 2, r, the letter form is used at the be·
ginning with considerable skill, and something of the personal tone is
maintained for perhaps fifty lines. But from that point the epistle be-
comes a versified essay, first, on the writing of poetry and, second,
on philosophy. The latter part contains nothing that Horace had

not said before, though it is here expressed in new forms, but the ’

strictures upon the state os literature in Rome are always interestlng.
The humorous opening of the Epistle‚ the bit os autobiography, and
the veiled allusion to Propertius are perhaps the best parts of the

lgttelp. As a whole it is scarcely equal to the other Epistles of this
oo .
