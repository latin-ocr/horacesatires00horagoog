INTRODUCTION

1 certain that Horace was, at the time when the Epistles were ,
written, a leader, perhaps a sort ol dean ol letters, among

Roman writers.

The course oi his lite as an artist up to the year 23 nc. is ,

, clearly revealed in his writings. He had begun by writing
satires in the general form set by Lucilius, but finding this in
several ways unsuited to his temperament and recognizing its
artistic limitations, he had made such modifications in it as to
amount to the creation, or perhaps the crystallization, oi a new
literary torm, the sermo, the ‘talk' on lile and art. 'These
modifications were carried still lurther in the Second Book of
the Satires3 the dialogue, which in the earlier book is only half
recognized, becomes in the Second Book the iramework oi the
sermo, and is worked out in the different satires with very great
care. During the same period, belore 30 ne, Horace was also
making his first attempts in lyric poetry. For this he chose
the somewhat restricted field oi r'ambi, that is, ol the form that
had been fixed by Archilochus, in which the iambic couplet was
used to express a more emotional satire than could be expressed
in hexameters. He did not, however, remain long content with
this simple form3 it was only the bridge that carried him over
from satire to the more complex lyric.

,The Odes, ol which three books were published as a com-
pleted whole in 23, represent a second and quite distinct stage
in Horace’s artistic development. In them he did not consider

’ that he was creating a new art form, but only that he was intro· y
ducing into Latin literature a form which had not before been ἶ

used there, the lyric form ol Alcaeus QQ· We have

too little oi the Greek lyric poetry to be able to judge in detail ¹

would perhaps not be correct to claim ior him more than he ¹

claimed ior himself. Yet it is probable enough that, as he

became master ol this new form and learned to use it freely

for his own purposes, he did with it what Vergil had done with
