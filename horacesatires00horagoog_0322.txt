-1t is altogether probable, though it is not definitely stated, that this
Epistle was written in the year 20, when Tiberius was making prepara·
tions sor his trip into Asia Minor. Os the Septimius whom the letter

, introduces nothing is known with certainty, but one of the Odes
(Carm. 2, 6) is addressed' to a Septimius, and a man of this name is
mentioned in a letter os Augustus to Horace, quoted in the Vita ol
Suetonius.

Some other letters os introduction have come down to us (Cic. ad
Fam. 2, 14 ; 7, ς ; Pliny, 4, 4), but noue so skillful and so charming as

of the attentions paid to him on account of his relation to Augustus,
but he was not inoepable os perceivipg the mingled hankness and deser·
