to explain the writer’s change from lyric poetry back to the social
commenta with which he began bis career in the Satires. This is
accomplished by the device of a supposed requestfrom Maecenas-
which mayor may not have been real-that Horace would continue
his writing of lyrics. ln answering this request the writer is able to
give, without the appearance of egotism, his reasons for following a
different course. The second purpose is to announce the fact that this
collection of writings contains, more distinctly tban tbe Satires, a kind
of life philosophy, not systematic and not too serious, yet by no means
wholly humorous.
