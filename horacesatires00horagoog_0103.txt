SERMONES [1, 6, 2

such an education as a knight ora senator might have given to his
son, attending me himself to guard me against the dangers of the city,
not deterred by the lear ol educating me above my station. Ι should
he mad to wish that Ι had had a different father. Ι will not even say,
as some do, that Ι was not responsible for my humble parentage. On
the contrary, Ι would not exchange my father lor any other, not even
sor one who had sat in the curule chair and worn the purple.

‘Fon after all, Ι prefer my quiet life. No hother about money, no
formal calls to make, no swarm os servants, no fuss. Ι stroll about
town as Ι please and watch the sights ol the streets3 1 go home to a
plain dinner and a good night's sleep, untroubled hy the thought os
early business engagements in the morning. Ι read or write, 1 take a
little exercise, Ι have a light lunch andan asternoon of leisure. That's
a great deal more comfortable than the lile ol the people who think
they have a position to maintain.' ¹

This satire belongs in subject and treatment with the third, the
fourth, and the tenth. lt springs directly out ol the circumstances ol
Horace's life at the time it was written and marks another step ip his

η progress from the earlier years of rebellious ohscurity to the assured

position ol the Second Book. His friendship with men ol rank, his
acceptance by Maecenas, and, in particular, the publication of the
account ol the journey to Brundisium had revived the old criticisms
which his position in the army ol Brutus had aroused and had given
new grounds lor suspecting him ol social and political ambitions. The
satire is in form a disclaimer ol such ambitions‚ while in substance it is

a defence ol the friends who had accorded him social recognition anda >

very manly and dignified declaration ol pride in his lather's wisdom and
of contentment with his own quiet life.
