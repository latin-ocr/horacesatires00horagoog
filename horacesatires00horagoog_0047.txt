This satire was written before 3, since the death of Tigellius, which
is there (vs. 3 ff.) referred to as having occurred sometime before, is
here spoken of as a quite recent event, and before 4, where (in vs. 91)
a line of this satire (vs. 27) is quoted. lt is therefore to be placed in
the group of early satires, with 7 and 8, written before the introduction
to Maecenas in 39 or 38 nc.

The announced subject of the satire is the tendency of men to run to
extremes, their inability to keep to the golden mean. Of this tendency

the first part, down to vs. 28, gives various illustratione, not lacking in ’

humor and unobjectionable in tone. But the particular illustration
which is treated in detail, and which occupies the rest of the satire, is
excess in sensual indulgence, and especially the vice of adultery, which
had become rife in the Ciceronian period and was still increasing in
Roman society.

The satire betrays in various ways the immaturity of the writer. It
isthe most personal of Horace's writings3 it is coarse in expression,
and it is intentionally sensational in manner. These characteristics are
in part the result of a too close adherence to the manner of Lucilius, in
part of a desire to attract attention, in part of the bitter and rebellious
feeling of the writer. Yet it is not difficult to find in it, as undoubtedly
Vergil and Varius did, the indications of what the writer was later to
become.
