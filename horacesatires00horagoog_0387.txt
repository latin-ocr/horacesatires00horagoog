ln this Epistle the personal tone is also subdued by the fact that it
was addressed to the Emperor. The opening lines, therefore, though
they are concemed entirely with the personal aspect and not at all with
the subject of the letter, are distinctly and quite properly formal. The
close, from vs. 250 to the end, is also personal, having to do with
Horace's own relation to literature and to Augustus, and here there is
a lighter tone, especially from vs. 264 to the end. At other points, too,
as in 214 ff, there is a certain measure of appeal to Augustus to use his
influence for the good of literature. In general, however, Horace has
. not made any very serious effort to preserve the illusion of a letter.

On the other hand, this is not a formal essay3 it is rather the un·
studied comment of a veteran man of letters upon the condition and
prospects of the literature of his time. The particular subjects selected
for comment or criticism are not indeed limited to Horace's own experi-
ence, but they are in part suggested by it. The whole of the first third
of the Epistle isa protest against the over-valuation of the early Latin
poetry and a defense of living writers, including Horace himself, against
the disposition to undervalue the present. This is, in some sense,a
continuation of the argument of Sat. 1, 43 r, 10; 2, 1, and Epist. 1, 19,
but it would be pressing it too far to find in it the motive of the whole
letter. ln other parts, in 118-138, in 139 ff, Horace is writing as a
student of literary history, selecting such portions of the rhetorical
tradition as suited his purpose and using thern to illustrate and detine
the situation of his time.

This Epistle deserves most careful reading. Much of the subject-
matter, it is true, has no immediate relation to modern conditions,
though the comments upon the stage are an exception and might
have been written fora magazine in this century. The literary history,
also, must be taken with much reserve3 it is only the current teaching
of the scholar and is in many points quite incorrect. But the easy turn
of the thought, me mastery of happy expression, the humor and the

occasional satire, all show that Horace came toward the close of life ἶ, ⁸
