and two sons, the Pisones. From the ,merely fonnal address ln vs. 6
and vs. 235 and the words O Pompilius sanguis in vss. 291 f. no infer·
enee can be drawn as to their identity. ln vs. 366 the elder son is
specially addressed in terms which imply, though not very clearly, that
he was just engaging or might soon engage in poetical composition.
These are but scanty indications of identity, and the uncertainty is
increased by the frequency of the name Piso; fourteen persons of that
'name are mentioned in the Onomast. Cic, ten in Tacitus, seven in
Suetonius. But there was a Gn. Calpnmius Piso, some years older
than Horace, who fought at Philippi and was afterward consul in 23 effe.
His eidest son, consul in 7 13.c.‚ was born about 44 and would have
been about twenty-five when this Epistle was written. There was also
a younger son. These may be the Pi'sones addressed, bnt it is evident
that any identification is at best a mere possibility. As nothing definite

. is known of the literary interests of these persons, the identification,

even if it were certain, would contribute little to the interpretationof
the Epistle.

The proper title of this poem is also uncertain. lt stands in most
of the Mss. as a separate composition, just before or just after the
Carmen Saeculare, as if it had been published by itself ; and it certainly
was put into circulation, with some degree of publicity, before Epist.
2, 1 was written. For such publication its title may have been Epistula
ad Pisones. But it is referred to by Quintilian, praef. 2, in the words
. . . Horati consilto, qui iu aru poetica suadet . . ., and again, 8, 3,
60, Horatius in prima parte libri de arte poetica fingit, with a quotation
of the first verse. This is the title used by most of the grammarians
and by the scholiasts. Itis also found in most of the Mss.‚ though it
may well have been introduced there from the grammatical tradition.
In most printed editions, because of the subject matter and the date,
the poem is placed aiter Eptst. 2, 2, as the third Epistle of the Second
Book, and it is often referred to, for convenience, as Eptst. 2, 3. If

Horace gave it a title, it was probably Epistula ad paones, perhaps ‚

with the addition of da Arte Pontica or Ars Poetica. Tradition has
fixed upon it the name Ars Poetica.

The course of thought from sentence to sentence and from one para·
graph to another is easily followed, but it resists all attempts to reduce
it to a scheme. All that can be said isthat the Epistle-consists of a
series of remarks upon poetry‚ followed (from vs. 309 to the end) by
similar remarks upon the training and ideals of the poet. ¹

The general course of the thought is as follows ε -

‘A poem, like a pointing, must be well composed, not tricked out
