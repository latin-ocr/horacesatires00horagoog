But though the setting and the details are pure burlesque, there is
a certain amount of se'rious purpose underneath, as in Sat. 2, 3, for
example, where the Stoic is burlesqued, but the iollies os mankind are
also satirized. The host at the banquet, who is here ridiculed on his
lighter side, is a type of the same man who is attacked with savage
directness in Eporl. 4, the man oi low station and no culture, whose
suddenly acquired wealth has not changed his nature. He is repre-
sented here as an aspiring epicure, proud of his knowledge of the art
os cookery and seeking to advance his acquaintance with Maecenas by

, giving him a particularly fine dinner. But the ridicule is directed quite
as much, perhaps even more, against the absurd solemnities of the
epicure. There are passages (vss. 6 ff, 43 ff, especially 85 ff.) which
are indistinguishable in tone and manner from parts of Sat. 2, 4, and
which have no point at all unless we understand them as we do that
satire, — as ironical parodies of the precepts of fine cookery.

This is not one oi the best of the satires. The humor is not always
in good taste3 there is too close an approach to horse-play and, though
Maecenas and the literary men are kept in the background, with the
evident purpose of guarding their dignity, the rest of the guests are not
superior in good-breeding to the host whom they ridicule. The scene
is, with some differentes, not unlike the supper described in Sat. 1, 5,
51 ff. and, in general, this satire has many of the characteristics, both
positive and negative, of Sat. 1, ς. The explanation is that Horace is
here also, as in 1, 5, following a satire of Lucilius (Charis. in Gr. Lat.
p. 100 K., Lucilius . . . deridens rusticam cenamy the fragments are
in Marx, 193 ft), doubtless improving upon the form, but hampered by
his model. The grave and sustained irony of Sat. a, 4, when no Lu-
cilian influence is discernible, is much superior to this.
