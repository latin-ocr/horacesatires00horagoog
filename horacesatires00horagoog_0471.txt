nec minimum meruere decus vestigi

aGraeca
ausi degqueleb re dmm W
vel qui praet a vel ur docuere toga as.

silue virtute foret clarisve potentius armis
290 quam lingua Latium si non offenderet unum-
quemque poetarum limae labor et mora. VoS, Ο
Pompilius sanguis, carmen reprehendite, quod non
multa dies et multa litura coercuit atque
praesectum decies non castigavit ad unguem.
, ²95 Ingenium misera quia fortunatius arte

28⁶. nec minimum: c'.c., ‘and
not th'e least ol their merits is the
fact that they have shown inde-
pendence.'

287. domestica facta: i. c., ‘that
they have used native material,
Roman legends.'

.288. praetextas: sc. fabulam
tragedies on themes from Roman
history, like the Brutus of Accius.
The name came from the toga
praetexta worn by the Roman
generals and heroes who were
represented in the plays. —toga·
tas: comedies in which Roman
citizens appeared, wearing the or·
dinary toga-docuere: the tech-
nical word for the poet's part in
preparing the play ior presentation
by ‘teaching' it to the actors.

289—290. virtute . . .armis:a
double expression sor a single
idea. - lingua: for literature in
general.

291. This thought is often ex·
pressed by Horace 3 Sat. r‚4, 12 f. ;
r, 10‚68—72; Epist. 2, 1, 167.

292. Pompilius sanguim the
claim of the Calpurnii (Pisones)
was that they were descended from
Numa Pompilius through a son
Calpur. This formos address is
hardly more than a variation on
Prionos.

294. praesectum...adunguem:
ci. Sat. 1, ς, 32, ad ungucwsoctus
lcomo; the figure is taken from the
testing ol the smoothness of a sur·
lace by passing the thumb nail
over it, the closely cut uail (prac-
scctum) would be especially sen-
sitive. —castigavitz general in
meaning (corrected, restrot‘ned),
not continuing the figure of prun-
ing, which is faintly suggested by
coercuit.

295· misera, fortunatius: the
words are quoted, as it were, from
the poets, who were expressing in
vivid language their acceptance ol
the dictum of Democritus; labor
seemed to them wretched and they
trusted to their talent for suc·
cess.
