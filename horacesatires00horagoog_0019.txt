INTRODUCTION

humorously detailed descriplions and travesties in the Second
Book make the iollowers ol this particular mania more promi·
nent than they actually were in Roman lile. But certainly the
society to which Horace’s friendship with Maecenas gave him
access was a highly complex society, one which brought before
his observant eye a most interesting variety ol types and oi in·
dividuals‚ and invited good-humored comment and even caustic
remark. The Satires are not me result ot so mechanical a
choice as Horace jokingly implies, but the inevitable expression
ot the reflections of such a man as Horace was upon sucha
’ society as that ot theAugustan Age. '

The form which Horace’s commentary on lite was to take
was already determined lor him. In this respect ancient
literature was to a high degree conventional and traditiona13
when once the type was fixed by the influence of some great
originator, the range ol subsequent deviation from the type was
small. Didactic poetry was written in hexameters from Hesiod
to Ovid; innovator as Euripides was, his variations from the
norm oi tragedy are in reality slight. Form and content are
identified under one name in the iambi oi Archilochus. The
form of Roman satire, or at least the prevalent form, was lixed
by C. Lucilius. He was an eques ol me period of the Gracchi
and the younger Scipio Africanus a man of education and rank,
a conservative in politicS, and a writer ot force and courage.
His range ol subjects was not very different from that oi Horace,
-literary criticism, ethical discussion, social comment-but
a large place was occupied by politica] satire, which was almost
inevitable in that stormy period and in the writings ol a friend
'of Scipio. In tone he was so lar as can be judged from the
extant fragments and from me statements of his successors,
extremely personal and harsh. The lact that the fragments ot .
his writings have come down largely in quotations by the gram-
marians, who were interested chiefly in unusual words or
phrases, makes it difficult to lorm an independent judgrnent
