Nothing in this satire fixes the date oi composition. lt can only
be said that it was written between 35 and 30 ne, and that in subject
and general treatment it is like the other satires of this book.

ln form it most closely resembles Sat. 2, 43 the main part oi it is
au account of certain sayings and doings related by another person to
Horace athis request‚ with a brief introductory dialogue. The sub·
ject-matter connects it both with Sat. 2, 2, as a contrast to simple
living, and with 2, 4, as a satire in a different vein upon the serious-
minded epicure.

The main body of it is a description of a dinner, given in much
detail. The names of the guests are mentioned and their places at the
table and there are elaborate descriptions of the food and oookery.
Alter the dinner had advanced a little and the host had shown a dis·
position to brag of his food and wines, some of the guests proposed
heavy drinking. The host turned their attention again to the sood, but
while he was deseribing one of the dishes, a canopy over the table fell
and covered the whole company with dust. The host at this mishap
burst into tears and was with difficulty induced by the encouragernents
of some of his guests‚ which he did not perceive to be ironical, to pro·
ceed with the least. When he did go on, he continued to talk so much
about the food, that the guests‚ in revenge, declined to eat it. The
satire ends abruptly, without the concluding dialogue or comment which
is generally found in the satires of this book.

This is not a description of some actual dinner at the house oi an
individual who might be identified. All attempts to connect the host,
Nasidienus Rufus, with some person known to us‚-sor example, with
Salvidienus Rusus,-fail in details and are mistaken in their purpose.
lt is quite inconceivable that Horace should have made public the
story oi such a dinner, at which Maecenas and Varius were guests‚
and should have represented a well-known man like Fundanius as
guilty of the extreme discourtesy of ridiculing the host whose invita-
tion he had accepted. To readers of Horace's time the mere fact that
the story is told by Fundanius, the writer of humorous plays, would at
once have given the clew to the burlesque character of the whole. lt
is no more to be taken as serious narrative than the legal consultation
in Sat. 2, 1, the discourse of Ofellus in 2, 2, the sermon of Damasippus
ina, 3, or in fact any satire of this book except the earlier half of the
sixth.
