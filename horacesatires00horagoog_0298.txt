Ι, 5, 1] HORATI

worthy ol preservation in this collection of letters. lt is, in the tirst
place, a very successful illustration‚ in concrete formos a fundamental
principle ol Horace's social philosophy. He is here in the position of
the host of no wealth or social position approaching a man ol high
standing and of importance in the world of affairs. The merit of the
invitation is that it recognizes these differences, but with such openness
and humor as to show that the writer did not overestimate their impor-
tance and was confident that his guest also did not give them undue
weight. As host, Horace is humorously profuse in saying that he is
making anxious preparations lor the dinner; as a friend, he takes for
Ἰ granted the absolute equallty which is the only foundation lor friend-
ship, 'without either servility or sels-assertion. To this subject his rela-
tion to Maecenas had led Horace to give careful attention, and itis the
theme ol Sat. 1, 6 and ol two EpistleS, 7 and 18, of this Book.

In the second place, the occasion gave an opportunity for the recom-
mendation of that philosophy os moderate enjoyment of pleasure to
which Horace so frequently recurs. The praise of wine was a standing
theme ol Greek and Roman lyric; an invitation to dinner furnished an
appropriate motive for introducing it again.
