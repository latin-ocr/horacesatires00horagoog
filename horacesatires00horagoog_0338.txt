1, 14, 1] HORATI

in Rome. You are inconsistent and I am not, but the real difference is
in our tastes. To yon my farm seems a desert and a place of hard
labor, and you long for pleasureS‚ while Ι have dropped all that kind
oi thing and want only peace. Each wants what the other has„ But
it won’t d03 the shoemaker will have to stick to his last, according to
the old saying'

This Epistle is in complete contrast to the one which immediately
precedes it. Itis a little disquisition on the inconsistencies oi men, as
illustrated by the steward's discontent with the life which he had once
greatly desired, and on the attractiveness oi the country, which seemed
all the stronger to Horace when he happened to be detainedin Rome
beyond his usual time. These themes Horace had treated before, in
Sat. 1, 1 and Sat. 2, 6, using the satire form. ln returning to them at
this later time, under the impulse of his longing to escape from the city,
he used the epistolary form with which he was then experimenting.
The vilicus ie, oi course, a mere figurehead3 the letter was not actually
sent to him at all; but the advantages oi the direct form oi address
appear in the individnal allusions (vss. 2-3‚ 6-7, 14—r 5, 19-30), which
illustrate the general doctrines that underlie the whole. There is,
too, a certain simplicity and directness in the langnage, though there
is, of course, no attempt to come down to the level of the steward's ,

comprehension. J .
