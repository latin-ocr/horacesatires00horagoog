by inference from this letter. The Epistle is supposed to be a hasty
note, sent by a messenger to overtake Vinnius before he reached Rome
and to remind him again of the author's instructions in regard to the
manner in which the gift should be presented to Augustus.

‘This is to remind you again, Vinnius, to be careful. Dou‘t make a
nuisance of yourself; your name, you see, exposes you to jibes. And
do try to be gracefu13 don't carry my books under your arm like a corn-
mon buudle. And don't brag about them, either. Remember what
l've told you and do be careful.’

This is not an actual letter, sent after Vinnius, but a humorous
Epistle handed tobim with the books and intended in reality for
Augustus. There is not a serious word in it; the elaborate and fussy
advice, the permission to throw the book away, the reference to the
badness of the road, are all fictitious. Vinnius was not a country clown,
but a common friend of Augustus and Horace, who undedook the little
commission for the poet, doubtless with pride. Nor was Augustus
so remote and great a personage that Horace felt it to be necessary
to approach him with elaborate mution. All this belongs to the
machinery, as it were, of the little play.

The facts were, in reality, something like this: in sending a copy
of his completed lyrics to Augustus, Horace desired to write a note of
presentation‚ like an inscription on a flyleaf. Sceking to avoid the
commonplace forms, he hit upon the little fiction of pretending great
anxiety about the reception of the gift and of expressing his ‘anxiety in
these fussy and exaggerated directions to the bearet. The note was,
of course, to be shown to Augustus.
