. HOR'ATI

12

This Epistle was written in the summer of the year 20 B.c., as the
closing lines show. The person addressed, Iccius, is the same young
man to whom, some tive or six years before, Horace had written an ode,
Carm. 1, 29. He is· otherwise unknown, but some traits of character
are clearly revealed hythe tone in which Horace addresses him. He
was one of the circle of younger men whom Horace knew well, a stu-
dent of philosophy, though probably not a serious scholar. He was
not rich and was looking for an opportunity to make his way in the
world. This he had sought to find by joining the expedition of Gallus
against the Persians and after the failure of this campaign he had be-
come the agent of Agrippa, taking charge of his estates in Sicily. This
Epistle was written in reply to a letter from Iccius, in which there was
some expression of dissatisfaction with his position and of regret that
business intersered with philosophy.

‘The tmsted agent of Agrippa, my dear young friend, should not oell
himself a poor man. If one has plenty to eat and health to enjoy it, he
is as rich as a king. Or if you have turned vegetarian, no amount of
money will make any difference to such a philosopher. You area
greater wonder than Democritus, to be so active in business and at the
same time so deep in philosophy. But, whether you are living high or
have become an ascetic, don't neglect my friend and your neighbor,
Pompeius Grosphus 3 heis a man you mn tmst.

‘The news at Rome is all cheerful3 victories everywhere and a fine
harvest in Italy.‘

This is, in form, one of the most successful of the Epistles. lt is
precisely such a letter as might have been written in prose, com-
menting upon the letter to which itis a reply, recommending a friend
to the notice of the recipient and giving in brief the news of the
day. Its tone, too, is entirely personal, as if it were meant to be
read only by the person addressed, and that tendency to fall into the
essay manner, which in some of the letters is out ‘of harmony with the
epistolary form, is here the more easily avoided, because the interest of
lccius in philosophy makes the introduction of that subject quite
natural. At the same time, the personal matters are so treated as
to be of general interest, and the revelation of the character of both
writer and recipient is most attractive. ln lightness of touch and in
humorous irony this letter resembles Epist. 1, 3, also addressed to a
younger friend.
