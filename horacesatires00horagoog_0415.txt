EPISTVLAE

Flore, bono claroque fidelis amice Neroni,
si quis forte velit puerum tibi vendere natum
Tibure vel Gabiis et tecum sic agat: ‘Hic et
candidus et talos a vertice pulcher ad imos
fiet eritque tuus nummorum milibus octo,
verna ministeriis ad nutus aptus eriles,
litterulis Graecis imbutus, idoneus arti
cuilibet; argilla quidvis imitaberis uda3
quin etiam canet indoctum sed dulce bibenti.
ro Multa fidem promissa levant, ubi plenius aequo
laudat venales qui vult extrudere merces,

r. Flore, Neroni: cf. Epist. 1,
3, 1-2, notes, and Eput. 1, 8, 2.

, 2. puerum: slave, not ‘boy,'
though the context shows that he
is young.

³· Tibure vel Gabiis: any two
Italian towns; a·slave born in
Italy, not a foreign captive. -
agat: deal, ila, ‘present his pro·
posal in these terms?

4. candidus: sair, of complex·
ion-talos avertice: proverbial
like the ¹English ‘from head to
loot.'

⁵· flet eritque: legal tautology,
like ‘to have and to hold,' em·
ployed here to give an air oi defi-
niteness and frankness to the offer.
—milibus octo: nearly 8400, an
ordinary price for a fairly good
slave. Davus, speaking ol him-
self as a cheap slave, says he was
worth 3100. The price named is
meant to be attractive, but not sus·
piciously low.

6. verm: a house slave, not a

common fieldlaborer.-1niniste·
riis: dative with aptus-adnutum
to be taken closely with mimiteriis
aptus, almost as a modifier;
‘quicktoperformhisdutiesatanod.’

7-8. litterulis . . . imbutus:
‘he knows a little Greek'; the
depreciatory tone is suggested by
the diminutive and expressed in
ambraus. Cf. Tac. Dial. 19, ele·
mentis studiorum etsi non instruc-
tus at certe imbutus. —arti cuill-
bet: there is a description in Ter.
Eun. 476 ff. of a young slave who
knows literature, wrestling, and
music. - argilla . . . uda: the fig-
ure os the artist making his clay
model is suggested by arti.

9. quin etiam: ia, ‘in fact he
already knows something of one
art, singing.'-indoctum: this
suggests again the srank man who
will not praise too highly what he
offers for sale. ’
