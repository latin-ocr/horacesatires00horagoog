LIBER SECVNDVS

The Second Book of the Satires was published in 30 nc, five years
¹ after the First Book, and the changes which the interval had produced
in the temper and in the art of Horace are quite evident; his tone is
less persona] and more mellow and he has adopted the dialogue form
instead of the monologue. In both respects the change is an advance.
The earlier satires‚ with all their geniality‚ are touched here and there
with sensationalism‚ and even the later work betrays at times a certain
uneasiness about his own position and success. But by the year 30
n.c. Horace, now about thirty-five years of age, had won recognition asa
writer. He was secure iu the esteem of a circle of friends ς he had accom-
modated himself, not indeed without difficulty, but quite sincerely, to
the great political changes which he had at first opposed, and he writes
like a man at peace with himself and with his world. He is not less

· serious3 in his treatment of philosophy he is more serious3 buthe is

less insistent, less urgent, and his touch is lighter. With this change in
tone the change iu form, from monologue to dialogue‚ aud especially toa
dialogue in which Horace himself plays onlya subordinate part, is quite
in harmony. A tendency toward informal dialogue is evident iu some
of the satires of the First Book (ag, r, 1, 30 ff.; 1,4, 38 ff), but the step
from this to the formal dialogue of 2, 1 and 2, 5 is a long one, and the
change was undoubtedly regarded by Horace as a distinct advance in
the form of satire.

There are no allusions in this satire which fix the date of composi·
tion. The reference to the Parthians (vs. 15) is entirely general and
might have been made before the battle of Actium, while Antonius was
still master of the East. But itis probable that this satire was written
after the rest of the book was completed‚ in accordance with the custom
which Horace had begun in Sat. 1, 1 and which he afterward followed
in Epod. r, r, Carm. r, 1, and Epist. r, 1. This would fix the date about
30 nc, after the battle of Actium, to which Caesaris znvzttz' (vs. 11)
may beanallusion. ·
