INTRODUCI'ION ’

Still others, men of³ Horace’s day, were in their liietime al

ready so much the subject ol open gossip and comment that
an allusion to them was no more properly ostensive or, indeed,
personal, than an allusion in a modern uewspaper to the men
whose names are upon everybody's lips. Many names are
fictitious, some pure inventions like the names in a novel,
others disguising an allusion to a real person. The residuum
oi actual personality‚ such as would be offensive to modern
feeling, is extremely small Direct attack upon an individual
was, in fact, as little to Horace's taste as to our own, and
was incompatible with the lightuess oi touch which he was
endeavoring to attain. Even the semblance oi severity, which
the Lucilian tradition obliged him to maintain in his earlier
work, grows less distinct as he becomes' conscious oi his pe-
culiar powers. The Second Book has less oi it than the First;
indeed, the first satire oi that book is a kind oi travesty of
the severely personal satire and, by implication‚ a renuncia-
tion oi it. The place of Horace in the history oi Roman
satire is, it is true, in the line oi succession from Lucilius,
but his own contribution to that history amounts almost to
the creation oi a new literary genre, a new variety oi satire.
The events in the liie oi Horace after the publication oi the
Epodes aud the Second Book in 30 nc. are oi interest to the
reader oi the Satires only in so iar as they interpret his earlier
period. He turned at once from satire to lyric poetry, following
still further the path upon which he had entered in the Epodes,
and published in 23 Bc. the first three books oi the Odes, to
which he gave the best oi his powers and the best years oi his
lire. Aside from other and more determining motivas—the
inner impulse and the fact that the lyric is a higher form of art
than satire,-the choice doubtless indicates also a feeling that
he had for the time exhausted the field oi satire, that he had
carried his modifications of the Lucilian type as iar as it was
possible ior him to carry them. But the habitos observation
