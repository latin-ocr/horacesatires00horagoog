PREFACE

Tins book will be found t'o Â¹differ from the many excel-
lent editions of the Satires accessible to American students
chiefly in the emphasis which l have desired to place upon
the thought of Horace, as distinguished from the language
or the verse or the allusions. That is, without denying
that Horace may be made useful as the basis for a study
of Roman life, and without forgetting that it is absurd to
talk of studying the thought, it the language is only imper-
fectly understood, I have nevertheless believed that ot all
the Latin writers read in college Horace was the one in
whose writings literary form could be most interestingly
studicd. In the Satires, too, the connection of thought is
peculiar and, at first, difficult to follow To meet this diffi-
culty and to ifacilitate the understanding of each satire as
a whole, the introductions have been made somewhat fuller

than is usual.
