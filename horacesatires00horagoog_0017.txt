INTRODUCl'lON

men back upon science and philosophy and law and literature,
was oi all periods in Roman history the one which offered the
most inviting material for humorous commentary. As on the
crowded streets of the city men oi every country and oi all
stations met and passed on, -a peasant from the mountains, a
deposed Eastern king, a Greek philosopher, a Roman noble, -
so in the complex social structure motives oi every possible
form and color were at work. Though public activities were
checked, the office-holding and office-secking politician flourished

schools oi philosophy, me Epicurean and the Stoic. Horace is
often, in a vague way, regarded as an Epicurean, buthe was, in
fact, oi no school or oi a school oi his own, and it is not as an Ι
Epicurean that he occasionally strikes a sudden blow at a Stoic‚
or, more oiten, burlesques the paradoxes oi the school with
ironical solemnity. He recognized the underlying truth oi the
Stoics; he was by no means unconscious of the seriousness oi
