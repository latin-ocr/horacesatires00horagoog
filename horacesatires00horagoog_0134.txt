There are many allusione in this satire to persons and events, but
none sufficiently definite to fix the date of composition. Evidently it
was written aster Sat. 4 and therefore alter 2, 7, and 8,·somewhere
between 38 nc. and 35. The large circle of friends whose names are
mentioned in the closing lines would indicate a late date, and the
general tone is that oi an epilogue to the whole collection, as the first
satire is an introduction to the whole. This interpretation also har-
monizes with the last line oi the satire (see notes).

‘It is quite true thatI said that Lucilius was a rough verse writer.
His power as a satirist l acknowledge, hut that alone does not makea
poet. Many other qualities are necessary to a poetic style, brevity,
variety, wit, such polished wit as is found in the Old Comedy, of which,
indeed, some ol my critioe seem never to have heard. The mingling
of Greek with Latin in Lucilius is not a merit, but a defect, no serious
Roman writer mixes the two languages or writes in Greek at all.

‘The grand style l leave to others to attempt, successfully or not.
My aim is less ambitlous. The fields of comedy and tragedy, of epic
and bucolic poetry, are well occupied and I have turned to satire, not,
however, to be the rival ol Lucilius or to lessen his glory. But it is
true that 1 have mentioned his defects, as he had noticed the defects
of Ennius and Accius. The copiousness ol Lucilius and his lack of

finish are real defects, which, it he were writing nov, he would himself ’

perceive and correct.

‘For smish of style appeals to the only public worth considering.
Hermogenes may not like my work, but it Plotius and Varius, Maecenas
and Vergil, approve, 1 need no other defence and can publish this book
of satires without misgivings.‘
