This Epistle was written in the year ao a.c., as the referenoe to the
recovery of Roman standards from the Parthians (vss. 56 f.) shows,
and is addressed to the Lollius to whom Epor. 1, 2 was written.

‘Lack of independence is a fault to be avoided, my dear Lollius, in
Ι your relation to a man of rank, but lack of common sense is worse.
The true course lies between. The lack of sels-respect makes a man a
mere parasite3 lack of judgment makes him assert his independence by
wrangling about trifles.

‘Do not try to rival your patron in extravagance3 he will not like you

the better for it, and you cannot afford it. The ill-natured witticism of

Volumnius, that the best way to ruin a man was to give him a fine coat
and let him try to live up to it, has enough of tnrth in it to serve asa
warning. Do not try. to learn his secrets and don't betray¹ his confi·
dences. Don't insist on following your own inclinations, even though
they may seem to you the better, Amphion, you know, gave up the
lyre to please his brother. lf your friend likes hunting better than
poetry, yield and go with him. lt will do you good and you are an
athlete, l have seen you on the Campus and l remember that sea fight
on your father’s estate. Be careful in your speech and in your conduct.
introduce only men that you know well, and if you make a mistake in
this, don't refuse to acknowledge it. But stand by your true friends, as
you expect them to stand by you. And conform even to your patron's
moods3 be serious when he is serious, and gay when he is gay, and
keep a cheerlul countenance at all times.

‘But above all fix your mind upon the lessons and ideals of philosophy
and learn from them the secret of a peaceful life.

‘As for me,l have attained to that peaceful life. Iask of the gods
nothing but a continuance of it?

This Epistle deals, in substance, with a situation like that which is
discussed in the Epistle immediately preceding, but with great differ·
ences both in form and in tone. The epistolary form is maintained
with much skill3 there are many personal touches, so that the character
and situation of the young Lollius are clearly defined and the unnamed
patron is more than a lay figure. And the letter closes with a passage
of peculiarly intimate sels-disclosure. All this is mu'ch superior to the ,
essay form of Epist. 1, 17. ln the tone, also, there is more of reality.
Here, even more distinctly than in the letter to Scaeva, Horace had
constantly in mind his own relation to Maecenas and his own efforts
to find the middle course between an undue deference andan unwise
