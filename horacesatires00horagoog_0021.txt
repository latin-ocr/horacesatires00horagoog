INTRODUCI'ION

desirous of raising it still further. Horace was, besides, by
nature a literary artist, to whom the shaping of phrases into
effective and pleasiug form was an end in itself. Itis, indeed,
surprising to a modern reader thm the justice of his guarded

and moderate criticisms of the style of Luciirus should have
been questioned by any intelligent student of Latin literature
in the Augustan Age. That he was entirely successful in his
attempt to improve in respect to style upon me work of his
predecessor has never been doubted.

The otber direction in which Horace endeavored to sur-
pass Lucilius, without deviating too widely from the type, led
him into greater difficulties. The satire of Lucilius was un·
doubtedly pungent and bitter in its attacks upon persons and
upon parties, and this savageness of tone, which in various
forms was familiar and agreeable to the Romans, was, in fact,
an essential element in satire of the Lucilian type. But it
was in every way impossible in the Augustan Age3 the polit-
ical situation between 42 and 31 uc. would not have borne
rough handling, and the softening of manners had put a check
upon personalities The problem, therefore, which presented
itself to Horace was to retain me pungency of individual
criticism with0ut violation of the canons of good taste and with·
out offense to public men. A part of the problem he made no
attempt to solve3 he left politics out of his satire entirely,
even at the time when his patriotic feeling was expressing
itself in the Epode quo, quo scelesti mitis? and in Epode 16. -
But to the problem of giving to his satire the appearance
without the reality of personal attack, he addressed himself
with much ingenuity. The Satires seem to bristle with proper
names but examination shows that only a very few of the
allusions'are in fact personal attacks. Many of the names
are taken frorn Lucilius and had long since ceased to be
anything but types in literature. Others are from the Cice· ’
ronian period, the names of men who were then notorious
