Stultus et insanus. Quid, si quis non sit avarus
160 continuo sanus? Minime. Cur, Stoice? Dicam.

Non est cardiacus (Craterum dixisse putato)

hic aeger. Recte est igitur surgetque? Negabit,

quod latus¹ aut renes morbo temptentur acuto.

Non est periurus neque sordidus: immolet aequis
165 hic porcum Laribus; verum ambitiosus et audax:

naviget Anticyram. Quid enim differt, barathrone

dones quicquid habeS, an numquam utare paratis?

Servius Oppidius Canusi duo praedia, dives

Stertinius, but the questions ex·
press the supposed attitude of a
listener. The use of Stoice, how-
ever, with its suggestion of some
slight scorn (cf. vs. 300), is not
dramatically correct3 cf. crepat,
vs. 33 and note-continuo: ie.
‘may we at once conclude that he
is sanel’

161 f. cardiacus: dyspcptic. —
Craterum: a physician of the
Ciceronian time, referred to in
adAtt. 12, 13, ¹3 12, 14, 4, as
worthyof confidence.— Recte est:
sc. ei, but translate personally.

163. temptentur: a hals-tech-
nical word of illness. The suij.
is used to imply that this is the
reason given by Craterus for his
refusal to let the patient get up.

¹⁶4·1⁶7· The applicationofthe
story and the transition from the
lolly of avarice to the folly of
ambition. - periurus, sordidus:
these adjectives go back in par·
ticular to vss. ¹25 ff, but with a
general reference to the avaricious

maru-immolet . . . porcum: i.c.
‘let him thank the gods for his
sanity-so far! ln Plautus,
Men. 289 ff, a pig is to be ol-
fered to the gods to bring about
a recovery from insanity3 here it
is in gratitude for exemption from
insanity; the two ideas are essen-
tially the sama—ambitiosus et
audax: recklessb‘ ambitiosas. —
naviget: ‘he may as well engage
passage for the land ot' helle-
bore3' sle. he is beyond question
amad-man. —barathro dones: the
emphasis through vs. 186 is upon
the heavy expense of a political
career, so that this paragraph
serves as a transition from avarice,
through its opposite, to ambition.
-numquam utare: cl. nescim uti
compositis, vss. 109 f.

168. Canusi: Canusium was
not far srom Venusia and this
story of Servius Oppidius (appi
dum ἲ) belongs in the same class
as the Ofellus satire (2, 2) and
the story told by Cervius (Sat.
